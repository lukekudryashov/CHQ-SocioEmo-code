  At the hospital it was determined I needed an implanted defibrellator to controle any further problems. they also put me on the medication Amiodarone which is a antiarrithmic.
 Last year I had a episode where the unit discharged five times about one minute apart, felt like getting hit in the chest with a sledge hammer.
  After that episode I feel a bit anxious about the next time this may accour, believe me Im not looking foreward to it.

  For those on Amiodarone what side affects do you feel. I get very fatigued.","Please see the web pages for more details on ICD and Amiodarone.
One problem with an ICD is that it sometimes delivers shocks when you do not need them. Even though a shock lasts a very short time, you can usually feel it. Every shock you feel should be notified to your doctor. The settings of the ICD may need to be adjusted or your medications may need to be changed.ICD problems can sometimes be prevented by programming the device to sound an alert when there is a problem. This can be done by your electrophysiologist. If you heart your ICD alert, you should immediately call your doctor.
WARNING: In June 2005, certain ICD models and biventricular pacemaker-defibrillators were recalled by the manufacturer because of a circuitry flaw that prevents the devices from delivering therapeutic electrical shocks when needed. The problem may result in patient death. Two deaths are believed to be associated with the malfunction. Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not make any specific recommendations, the agency encourages patients who may have such a device to ask their health care doctor if they should have it removed or replaced. The devices affected by this recall are:

2842187,Question About Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.?,"I know that this is not a medical community but perhaps someone here will have information on this for me.  Opinions are also helpful.

10 years ago my b/f was in a car accident with 2 friends and he was the only survivor. Although he was not the driver in the accident he has suffered from PTSD and completely stopped driving. Since that time he has tried driving a few times but each time he tries he has so much stress that he vomits afterward (sorry for being gross) and does not look forward to trying again. 

Now he has just started an awesome job and is very excited.  We both agree that with the field he is working in it would be very good for him to be able to drive again. 

So last week he started his new job driving on his own, about 20 min. each way but is having a hard time - getting sick and stressed.

Its only been 8 days but I'm worried that this is hurting him more than helping him. Has anyone dealt with this? Do you think he might get better?  What should he do?","If you have not experienced PTSD, it's hard to explain the feeling.  If you know any older citizens who served in the Gulf War,  Vietnam War or even World War II, for instance, you can ask them about being """"shell shocked"""", or PTSD.  For some people it never goes away.  I know from experience (an almost fatal auto accident that crippled me and took my professional life away at no fault of my own) that it's still there, under the surface, after 5 years.  However, I made myself get in the car and deal with it.  I think your b/f is on the right track and I'm impressed that he's willing to face his greatest fears.  You go ahead and encourage him every way you can and let him be a man and have a full life again without being co-dependent on anyone else.  He doesn't need to be an emotional cripple. What would he do if you weren't there to drive him??  He'll be proud of himself before long.  A pat on the back goes a long way.  So he might have stressful moment or two; he can learn to deal with it and get stronger and should continue to get professional help as long as he needs it.  He probably is feeling guilty as hell because he lived; not to mention every thing else involved.  Let him go...give him a nudge and hold him when he needs it.  Encourage him to help others with this problem.  Helping is great healing therapy for him and others.  He'll be living with this for a long time.

1502483,Is this normal?,"Is this normal? The last two days I have had hard bowel movements that have caused me to bleed. I am a 25 year old female and weigh 115 pounds (and no I am not menstruating).  I usually have normal bowel movements, and I also have IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) which causes a soft stool and more frequent bowel movements than normal. I have IBS as a result of having E-coli in 2000 (the Walkerton, Ontario Canada E-coli disaster) Iï¿½m sure you heard about it on the news. The whole town had bloody diarrhea. 

Anywho, that was the last time I had blood in my stool. However, I do not think that I have E-coli right now, but because I did have it before it raises some concern. I do not believe I have e-coli because when I did have it I had horrible cramping and bloody diarrhea. Right now, the last two days I have had no cramping, my stool is hard and the blood I donï¿½t think is actually in my stool, I think it is the direct result of my hard bowel movement. Anyways, the question that I am asking is, is this normal? Has anyone else experienced this? And what is your opinion on my condition? Is this a result of not enough exercise or something that I ate or something else? Should I be concerned?

- Worried.","Don't worry too muvh!
A friend had the same concern recently.But it's not too serious, as you said, he was told the blood was due to stressing to pass the stool.But he was advised to avoid future occurrences as it can become serious if you develop hemorrhages inside(due to the straining).
I think you should begin to drink lots of water and high fibre to prevent the problem escalating, as the doc advised him.

I hope i can help, i had a car crash 4 year ago, wrote off my car and the other persons car, i was driving, not my fault it takes a long time to come to terms with this kind of thing.  it is called post traumatic stress.  

A few sessions with counceling will not help, it is a long process and you need to keep going.  you can e mail me if you wish to talk about it, I am not a councelor but It may help to talk to others.

I tried to avoid the crash but could not avoid what was going to happen, luckily no one was killed just serious whiplash and a few bruises and pains.  Time heals even now I have never forgot about it but more come to accept it as unavoidable and thank the lord no one lost life that day.  I still get nervouse in traffic when I drive and it has had an impact on me as a driver but I just try to move on and it gets easier.   Fell free to mail me if you want some one to chat with it may help.  

Please consider going back to psychiatrist and give it a fair chance to work.  first few sesions is about getting to klknow you  and building up a trust with them before you will commit to talking to them I say possibly about 4 to 6 months before you feel better there.

107231,concerning my daughter?,"it all started when she was 2 months pregnant. the nauseas feeling, even throwing up. But there was also excruciating pain in the stomach. it got so severe that she ended up spending most of the pregnancy in the hospitals with a demerol drip. she has been to all the hospitals in the area plus some that are 50 miles away. Given all the test that the doctors can imagine. Her veins colapsed from all the needles. no one can figure out what is going on. It has been a year and a half since she delivered a healthy little girl, but the pain and vomiting still persist. Has anyone out there ever gone through this and can you tell me what is going on. Its not her pancreas, galbladder, intestines or anything that the doctors can put a finger on.   Please help, we are desparate.","First, is your daughter taking any supplements or prescription medications - especially prescription ones?  When you are taking a prescription and complain about a possible side effect, most doctors won't believe you if your complaint is not one of those listed as a potential side effect  by the drug manufacturer.  Yet as we know, each body is different.  Therefore whatever you are experiencing could be a little known side effect.  When drug companies conduct clinical trials, they often don't report findings that are less than .5% of the test population.  If you happen to be part of that .5%, however, you know that what you experienced is very real, indeed.

I recently underwent a host of tests for recurrent nausea and vomiting.  My mother asked me about medications I was taking and  immediately homed in on one of my medications as one she had been unable to take.  Nausea and vomiting were not listed as possible side effects, but on the advice of my mother and under the care of my physician, I quit taking the medicine in question.  In only three days, the problem was resolved.

If your daughter's problem cannot be tied to a medication or supplement she is ingesting, my next question would be whether or not she has seen an allergist.  Some food allergies can cause nausea and vomiting.  Of course, there are usually accompanying symptoms like edema or rash if that it the case.

A final question would be whether your daughter has been evaluated by an endocrinologist?  I had a friend whose daughter suffered for years with a similar problem before finally being diagnosed with a digestive disorder.  She now eats five small meals daily, has eliminated certain foods from her diet completely  and limits consumption of other foods to a fraction of what she used to eat.  She has been pain and nausea -free for four or five  years.

Medicine is not an exact science.  Generally, a diagnosis is reached either by determining what is NOT going on or on the assumption if X number of people experiencing what you're experiencing have Y disease, then by default that must be what you have.  

Unfortunately, not every ailment is easily diagnosed.  Furthermore, some diseases mimic other diseases so even when you get a diagnosis it can be incorrect.

I realize it is frustrating to continue seeking medical advice, but your best line of defense it to continue to seek help until someone comes up with the right diagnosis.  And if you have not seen an allergist or an endocrinologist, by all means get your daughter to consult one.  It's her body.  She must  i n s i s t  the doctors continue to evaluate her specifics until they figure out what is wrong! 

By offering your situation in this forum, it may be someone will have experienced the same thing and with the information they provide you, you will be armed for the next trip to the doctor.  You are doing all the right things by being PROactive where your daughter's health is concerned.  Hang in there because there IS an answer.  You simply have to continue to search until you find it.","pregnancy, pain and vomiting",,,NA,,,,,"It has been a year and a half since she delivered a healthy little girl, but the pain and vomiting still persist.",pain and vomiting still persist,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,,Has anyone out there ever gone through this and can you tell me what is going on.,Yes:  You are doing all the right things by being PROactive where your daughter's health is concerned.

2456611,I wasn't going to ask this question. But who knows anything about gallbladders?,"I went to my doctor with bad pain in the upper part of my stomach, just below my breasts.

I also experienced a lot of pain in my shoulders and was told that is part of it. I found that if I stayed away from all fatty and fried foods I would feel a """"little"""" better.

When this happened, I was unable to lie down, sit up or anything else. I just couldn't get comfortable. The last attack came when I ate chili for dinner.  Wow! I ended up in the emergency room and after an ultra sound, was told I was off to the operating room. My Doctor told me it wasn't life threatening, the pain was from the gall bladder having spasms when the stone was blocking the bile which put me into almost a frenzy of pain.  I had the Old surgery, this was before the laproscopic surgery was around.  I lost 26 lbs through the ordeal as well.
Later, I met a friend who also had his gallbladder removed only his was gangerous!  If he didn't have surgery right away he would have died!  So it is nothing to fool around with, if you have another attack, go to the hospital for an ultra-sound where they will determine what needs to be done....in the meantime, plenty of fluids, rest as much as you can and be very careful what you eat.  Avoid spices, eat bland until this is taken care of.  I let mine go about a year and felt so good after that I am still shaking my head as to why I didn't do it sooner!

Lupus is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect various parts of the body, especially the skin, joints, blood, and kidneys. The body's immune system normally makes proteins called antibodies to protect the body against viruses, bacteria, and other foreign materials. These foreign materials are called antigens. In an autoimmune disorder such as lupus, the immune system loses its ability to tell the difference between foreign substances (antigens) and its own cells and tissues. The immune system then makes antibodies directed against """"self."""" These antibodies, called """"auto-antibodies,"""" react with the """"self"""" antigens to form immune complexes.

1883135,Does oxycodone cause edema?,"I have a feeling that my father is back to taking oxycodone.  He finished a rehab program several months ago but He looks really bad recently.  His face stays red as a tomato, he has severe edema (his feet can't even fit into his shoes), constant sweating, and extreme sleepiness.  I asked him if he was back on the pills and of coarse he denied it.  I'm just wondering if these symptoms sound anything like what the oxycodone will do to you.","Oxycodone is a Category 2 Schedule drug with a high risk of abuse. The Symptoms of abuse are what you described. I checked my Mosbys and Tabers Medical Books, and both say the same. I hate to give advice on here unless I see it in bold print.
The only thing higher is a class 1, and thats cocaine...Do you know who is prescribing it? 

Edema can be a reaction, and if he has edema, that can cause grave dangers, of which I am sure you are aware of.
Edema is the increase of interstitial fluid in any organ. Generally, the amount of interstitial fluid is in the balance of homeostasis. Increased secretion of fluid into the interstitium or impaired removal of this fluid may cause edema.

Generation of interstitial fluid is regulated by Starling equation of Tissue Fluid which states that it depends on the balance of osmotic pressure and of hydrostatic pressure across the capillary walls. Consequently, anything that increases oncotic pressure outside blood vessels (for example inflammation), or reduces oncotic pressure in the blood (states of low plasma osmolality, for example cirrhosis) will cause edema. Increased hydrostatic pressure inside the blood vessel (for example in heart failure) will have the same effect.

Abnormal removal of interstitial fluid is caused by obstruction of the lymphatic system, for example due to pressure from a cancer or enlarged lymph nodes, destruction of lymph vessels by radiotherapy, or infiltration of the lymphatics by infection such as elephantiasis.","oxycodone, edema",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,He finished a rehab program several months ago but He looks really bad recently.,"oxycodone, edema",,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,NA,NA,,Yes:  I'm just wondering if these symptoms sound anything like what the oxycodone will do to you.,,,,,Yes: Whole Answer
1386614,General Anxiety Disorder?,"I am not sure I have GAD or not.

I have been having chronic insomnia for more than 10 years now.  I couldn't turn off my brain at night.  Even if i manage to fall to sleep, i would only sleep 6 to 7 hours at most and i feel dead tired in the morning.  (I generally need 9 hours of solid sleep each night in order to function properly the next day.)  BUT, if i go to bed (at or near bed time) just to lie down and rest (eg, before taking bath) without the intention of actually sleeping, i would fall to sleep pretty fast.  [Strange, I don't know why.]

I've been having this problem since 10 years ago, at which time i started to have the following feelings: (i) hopelessness, (ii) loneliness, (iii) anxiety, (iv) lack of energy, desire, etc

I am taking Remeron now, and, as a result, don't have any sleeping problem.  But, obviously I don't want to take it forever.

My questions are: 
(a) What's my problems? and 
(b) is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy the [better] answer to my problem?","Sounds like you might have a GAD-Depression combo (not exactly the two-for-one deal you were going for, huh?) A few things could be going on: the sleeplessness could be causing the anxiety and feelings of hopelessness (because, as I'm sure you know, not getting enough sleep can really mess you up), OR the anxiety and hopelessness could be causing your sleeplessness. 

I recommend going to the doctor (your regular doctor is fine) and telling him or her what's been going on. He or she may take you off the Remeron and put you on an antidepressant/antianxiety med, like Lexapro, which helps both those symptoms. Of course, the catch 22 in all of this is some of these meds cause insomnia, so your doctor may prescribe a light sleep aid to take before bedtime. 

As far as cognitive behavioral therapy, I'm not sure how much that would help you. Instead, your doctor may recommend talk therapy to help you cope with these feelings. Either way, be sure to talk with your doc first and get his or her opinion on the whole situation--and be very straightforward with what's going on. 

Personal tip: if you do end up taking another med that causes insomnia, try taking a Melatonin supplement in lieu of a prescription sleep aid. You can find it in the supplement aisle in any drug store. They come in 3mg and 5mg strengths. It also won't interfere with any other meds you might be taking, because melatonin is already produced in the brain. It's really made a difference for me :)

Ask your doctor for a referal to an endocrinologist who can evaluate your hormonal system in better detail than a primary care physician can.
Serotonin syndroem comes to mind, your doctor can check 5 HIAA in a 24 hour urine to rule out carcinoid syndrome.
many medicines can cuase this from certain anti-emetics to antidepressants including effexor - other medicines can cuase this in combination even such combinations as imitrex and zoloft. 
in additon to a thorough endocrine work up ask your doctor for a referal to a dermatologist who can do botox injections for your hyperhydrosis - they are miraculously effective and even covered by insurance.
There are also surgeons who can destroy the nerves that cause excessive sweatiness. Ask your doctor about drysol for hyperhydrosis as well.
If you take ANY herbs or supplements make sure your doctor can review them all.

3322294,Anyone know how to prevent kidney stones?,"I have diabetes and am on med that increases chance of stones. I've heard they are painful, and I DON'T do pain, so I need to avoid these!
I've heard that citrus was good. Then I heard that grapefruit was the worst, but that lemon was still okay.
I heard that cranberries were the ticket, so I've been eating and drinking all things cranberry, but yesterday I read that they are terrible.
I'm so confused!
Anyone ..........","My family has history of kidney stone and bladder stones.  It was very very painful for them as well as the relatives that took care of them watching them suffer.

It has then become a family practice to avoid these problems, so hopefully I can be some kind of help here.

Kidney stone or any kind of stone development is partly due to eating habit and behavior pattern.  So watchout on your diet and how you move about the day should solve this problem completely.

The stone is due to deposit of minerals in your body, most likely in your urine fluid.  There are also bacteria in your urine that will convert your urine into ammonia, which will help form these stones in your Kidney or bladder.  The stone takes anywhere from 4-6 years to form, as long as you take care of youself it shouldn't happen to you.

You should watching out your mineral intake such as calcium and magnesian (salt), just keep it balance and don't eat too much of it.  That should lower your mineral deposit in your fluid.  But don't go on a low-calcium diet, otherwise your body will be lack of calcium and other problem will arises.

You should also watch out for sitting down for a long period of time, since it will slow down your blood circulation in your lower back (kidney) area, just remember to get up and walk around for 5-10 mins every 45-60mins to help your blood circulate.  

Also if you sit down in a chair and lay back your back, it creates pressure / tension in your lower back part of your body.  Try not to lay backward when you sitting down and instead sit straight, a good posture would help your blood flow and ease tension in your lower back.

You also need to drink enough water during the day.  Having water constantly flowing through your body will dilute your urine and help your body get rid of mineral deposit through daily urine discharge.  

By diluting your urine you also decrease the chance of the bacteria converting your urine into ammonia, since your urine is not that concentrated and not much to convert.

The last thing to do is exercise regularly, like jogging / swimming or some kind of sport 2-3 times a week to keep the body in shape.  A good cardiovascular exercise that would boost blood circulation will definitely help you prevent any disease.

1483105,Lasik/Laser eye surgery?,"I have read a few questions and answers.  I am aware of prices and risks.  Can anyone who has had this surgery tell me about the prep before the surgery.  Someone said he had to wear his glasses for a few weeks right before he had it done.  And any other side effects other than the halo light?  Also, I read a few people said about only getting 1 eye done so they could read...I don't understand this?  Why only 1 eye, wouldn't it be blurry trying to see like that?  I know when I have 1 contact out it is not that easy to see.  But, anyways, I'd appreciate some opinions and feedback!  Thanks!
Prep","You'll need to wear your glasses (leave your contacts out) for two weeks prior to surgery (that's the FDA recommended waiting time for soft contact wearers -- it's longer for people with hard contacts of toric or RPG lenses).  This is necessary because your contact lenses change the shape of your eye; you want your eyes to get back to normal before they start up that laser, otherwise they'd be doing surgery on a surface that's still changing!

As for getting the eyes done together or at different times...

These days, most people who have Lasik get both eyes done at once.  If you have them done separately, you'll find that it isn't at all like when you take one lens out right now.  As soon as the surgery is over, you'll start seeing an improvement, so the vision in your """"corrected"""" eye and the vision in the other eye (with the contact lens) are going to be a lot closer than you think. 

I got mine done 1 month apart because I was having PRK (which has a longer healing time) and they wanted to make sure that Eye #1 was responding well before doing Eye #2.  For two weeks before the second surgery, I had to wear my glasses, so I just popped one lens out of the frame.  It looked a little goofy but it was well worth it knowing I'd never have to wear those glasses or lenses again! 

Other than that, there's not much prep involved until you get to the doctor's office and they give you some drops and maybe some medication.

Afterwards, there can be side effects, some more likely than others.  Glare and halos are most common.  It's also possible that your vision may not become """"perfect"""" afterwards, and you have to accept that possibility.  Mine isn't perfect, probably because my eyes were so horrible to begin with (-9) -- but I still consider this surgery the best thing I could ever have done for myself and my health!  Do I get halos?  Yes, at night, and I still say it's worth it!  Pick a doctor who has a great reputation.

Fibromyalgia associated syndromes

It is not unusual for fibromyalgia patients to have an array of bodily complaints other than musculoskeletal pain. It is now thought that these symptoms are a result of the abnormal sensory processing ï¿½ as described in the previous section. Recognition and treatment of these associated problems are important in the overall management of your fibromyalgia. 

Non-restorative sleep
Cognitive dysfunction
Chronic fatigue
Cold intolerance
Restless leg syndrome
Multiple sensitivities
Irritable bowel syndrome
Dizziness
Irritable bladder syndrome
Neurally mediated hypotension

1. Chronic fatigue: The common treatable cause of chronic fatigue in fibromyalgia patients are: (1) inappropriate dosing of medications (TCAs, drugs with antihistamine actions, benzodiazapines etc.), (2) depression, (3) aerobic deconditioning, (3) a primary sleep disorder (e.g. sleep apnea), (4) non-restorative sleep (see above) and (5) neurally mediated hypotension (see below). A new drug called Provigil is of some help when used intermittently for management of fatigue.

2. Restless leg syndrome: This strictly refers to daytime (usually maximal in the evening) symptoms of (1) unusual sensations in the lower limbs (but can occur in arms or even scalp) that are often described as paresthesia (numbness, tingling, itching, muscle crawling) and (2) a restlessness, in that stretching or walking eases the sensory symptoms. This daytime symptomatology is nearly always accompanied by a sleep disorder - now referred to as periodic limb movement disorder (formerly nocturnal myoclonus). Treatment is simple and very effective ï¿½ DOPA / Levodopa (Sinemet) in an early evening dose of 10/100 (a minority require a higher dose or use of the long acting preparations).

3. Irritable bowel syndrome: This common syndrome of GI distress that occurs in about 20% of the general population is found in about 60% of fibromyalgia patients. The symptoms are those of abdominal pain, distension with an altered bowel habit (constipation, diarrhea or an alternating disturbance). Typically the abdominal discomfort is improved by bowel evacuation. Due to abnormal sensory processing these symptoms may be quite distressing to fibromyalgia patients. Treatment involves (1) elimination of foods that aggravate symptoms, (2) minimizing psychological distress, (3) adhering to basic rules for maintaining a regular bowel habit, (4) prescribing medications for specific symptoms; constipation (stool softener, fiber supplementation and gentle laxatives such as bisacodyl), diarrhea (loperamide or diphenoxylate) and antispasmodics (dicyclomine or anticholinergic / sedative preparations such as Donnatal).

4. Irritable bladder syndrome: This is found in 40-60% of fibromyalgia patients. The initial incorrect diagnoses are usually recurrent urinary tract infections, interstitial cystitis or a gynecological condition. Once these possibilities have been ruled out a diagnosis of irritable bladder syndrome (also called female urethal syndrome) should be considered. The typical symptoms are those of suprapubic discomfort with an urgency to void, often accompanied by frequency and dysuria. In a sub-population of fibromyalgia patients this is related to a myofascial trigger point in the pubic insertion of the rectus abdominus muscles ï¿½ and may be helped by a procaine myofascial trigger point injection).

I always considered myself a very patient person, but when he's throwing his """"fits"""" as we call them, it is extremely hard for me to not lose my temper also.","PTSD is such a difficult thing to deal with--for both the sufferer and those around them, as I'm sure you know. I'm glad your loved one is getting help (counceling, I hope, and meds.)

Many times, the majority of attention is paid to the sufferer and there is very little thought into how the caretaker is doing. Your health is just as important as his--you need to provide strength and have the will to help him through the roughest of times. 

I dealt with PTSD a few years ago, and though it wasn't nearly as bad as the trauma of war, I'm sure, it's stil hell. 

Have you ever had a nightmare where you swore it was real, then woke up and were so relieved it was just a dream? This is a diluted example of what PTSD is like--only it's all the time, day or night.

I recommend making your home as much of a sanctuary for him as possible. Put on some soothing music, light a few lavender-scented candles and keep the atmosphere as calm as possible.

It's basically a """"pyramid"""" workout and this is what you do:

1. Choose the exercise you want to work on.  The first set of repetitions you do, do 12-15 reps on the lightest weight you want to use.  Rest about 30 seconds before you do the next set of repetitions.
2. The second set of repetitions do 8-12 reps with a slightly heavier weight, but not too heavy.  Rest again for 30 seconds and get ready for the 3rd set.
3. Third set choose the heaviest weight you can do (without hurting yourself) but only do 4-8 reps this time.  Rest again for 30 seconds and then move onto the next completely different exercise and repeat this process of pyramiding up again.

Do your entire workout 2-3 times with each different exercise and you will see results quickly. Remember to drink plenty of water and just concentrate on fruits and vegetables and lean protein while you are on this until you have a great time on your vacation.

I posted a question about this procedure, it was agony, and I was in hospital for two weeks over Xmas.  It did not improve, in fact pain was worse than pre-op, so had me back in March 17th for 4th nerve root block.  That kicked in after about 3 weeks.

I started Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo in March of this year. I have gained, at most, about four pounds while on the pill, but considering I moved to college and my lifestyle habits have changed a lot, I cannot blame the gain entirely on the pill. 
I do know, however, that before I was on the pill, I could lose weight and keep it off incredibly easy. Now, I exercise three to five times a week, for about 45-60 minutes each time, doing both cardio and weights. I also try to watch what I eat (although I don't do as great a job at that). Despite working so much harder now, I have not lost any weight in three months of exercising. I have a feeling the inability to lose weight IS due to the pill.  
This really isn't a vanity issue; my entire family has weight, diabetes and heart problems, so it is very important to me to keep my weight down and under control.
Will getting off the pill for two months or so help me with this problem?","3. Myth: The pill will make me gain weight.
Fact: Most women do not gain weight on the pill. But if you do it is likely to be water retention, limited to about 2 pounds. However, some women find the pill increases their appetite, which in turn causes overeating and weight gain. The solution: Switch to a different birth control pill. http://www.webmd.com/content/Article/105/107875.htm?pagenumber=3

I'm on the pill. Could it be making me fat? By Deb Levine, MA 

May 1, 2000 (San Francisco) -- There may be several reasons you put on weight while on the birth control pill. 
The hormones in the Pill (estrogen and progesterone) can alter water metabolism, sometimes causing fluid retention (called edema). A woman could experience a weight gain of up to five pounds from this temporary side effect that usually begins in the first month and lasts for four to six weeks. Decreasing your intake of salt could lessen this water gain, so you might want to cut down on chips, pretzels, and other salty foods when you're on the Pill. 
In addition, the hormones in some types of birth control pills can cause increased or decreased appetite, leading to weight gain or loss. If you notice a weight change, discuss it with your doctor during your next visit. 
You might also ask your doctor if you can switch to one of the pills that contains a lower dose of estrogen if you are not already taking one. According to a study of 463 women published in the March 13, 2000 issue of the journal Contraception, side effects such as bloating and breast tenderness were one-third less common in women taking lower-dose pills than those taking higher-dose ones, without a loss of effectiveness in preventing pregnancy. 
You should also report to your doctor any problem lasting more than two or three menstrual cycles. And if you have severe pain or swelling in the legs (thigh or calf), severe headache, dizziness, weakness, numbness, blurred vision (or loss of sight), speech problems, chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain, report them to your physician immediately. These symptoms could indicate a more serious condition such as a heart problem or abnormal blood clotting.

780455,"Which is the bigger problem?  Obesity, or aneorexia?","Apparently the pressure is on young women everywhere that they have to be as skinny as inhumanly possible to be sexy, but end up being undesirable because they just end up looking dead.  Conversely, being fat is also nothing to be ashamed about, because most of it is """"genetic"""" anyway, and there's no point in trying to change who you are (even if that means succumbing to diabetes).  Which is worse; being too skinny or being too fat?","Today, 64.5 percent of adult Americans (about 127 million) are categorized as being overweight or obese. Each year, obesity causes at least 300,000 excess deaths in the U.S., and healthcare costs of American adults with obesity amount to approximately $100 billion.

Recent studies on the epidemiology of anorexia have suggested an incidence of between 8 and 13 cases per 100,000 persons per year and an average prevalence of 0.3% using strict criteria for diagnosis. These studies also confirm the view that the condition largely affects young adolescent females, with females aged between 15 and 19 making up 40% of all cases. Furthermore, the majority of cases are unlikely to be in contact with mental health services.

While it was once thought that obesity was largely due to genes, it is not the case so much today.  Many people are eating for more reasons than sustaining hunger; psychological or mental disorders play a part, lack of activity, inadequate nutrients replace the nutritional value the body needs (i.e., fat burgers, fried foods, etc.).

With so few reporting their anorexic condition to the medical field, it is difficult to gauge numbers that would be in comparison to obesity to measure hospital costs, etc.

Personally, I think both conditions are problematic but would say that obesity is a bigger problem due to the NUMBER of individuals it has plagued.  WIth insufficient data to compare, it seems though, unlikely, that there are that many suffering from anorexia (by viewing physical appearance) than that of obese people (there seem to be more and more waddling around these days - and they are younger than before).",Obesity,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,,,No

She has been taking these medicines for a month now, and she hasn't had any improvement.  She absolutely refuseds therapy and hospital care.  What are your experiences with bipolar disorder, and what can I do for my grandmother?","I am also bipolar, and very knowledgeable about the illness.. The doctor always knows best but has no real chance of being in a position to help if he has to make guesses at her condition. 
I am thinking that perhaps her bipolar disorder may have morphed into a more serious combination of many different afflictions as a result of her age and the traumatic loss of her life partner..
Find a way to speak with her doctor or psychiatrist and explain the finer details of her actions.. she may not be honest with him because of the paranoia of how he might try to help.. might be schizophrenia, dementia, post traumatic stress disorder.. or even being bipolar with new tendencies (it gets much worse over time, especially when treatment is abandoned and she stops the meds) 
look into these possibilities. Doctors know best, always.. but they need your help to be effective, especially in your grandmothers case.. when she isn't being very cooperative and taking a much more proactive approach towards her own wellbeing. She needs her medicine.. and she needs your help to get this under control. It seems that she is in a bad spot with being so mixed up in all of the emotions of what is happening all around her. Powerlessness is a horrible thing.. it seems she desperatly needs a helping hand.

54406,Why are people so quick to suggest pills as an answer to depression and other mental illness?,"Many times pills are not actually needed.  Out of 100 perscriptions a doctor writes, 5-10 of them may actually be necessary.  In many cases these drugs can worsen your health metally and physically.  Sometimes, I think,  people just need some time to figure things out.  I realize this is not always the case as I have stated above.  Some people are deffinitely in need of meds.  Before you take any drug you should do some research to see if the benefits outweigh the negative effects. These drugs cause serious side effects and are not always necessary.  That's the bottom line.","I think we live in a society who have come to think the solutions to all of life's problems comes in the form of a substance of one form or another.  Sometimes it is, and sometimes not.  I went through my own period of severe depression after my sister was killed.  I felt like my world had ended.  After months of downward spiraling, I decided to go to a doctor because the suicide thoughts were scaring me.  I wanted help.  I was given a prescription anti-depressant, and who knows, maybe that saved me.  I didn't feel good though.  I didn't really feel anything.  I didn't care for that.  I didn't like the other side effects either.  I stayed on them for a few months but eventually got off of them.  I struggled with depression for years afterward (about four).  It varied in degrees.  Sometimes I couldn't get out of bed, sometimes I could function.  I always felt a sense of impending doom.  Talking about how I felt with my friends and family helped a great deal, and time helped too.  But NOTHING helped as much as adopting a regular exercise program.  I eventually began running on an elliptical trainer at the gym for 45 minutes 3-5 days a week, and I was amazed at how great I felt.  It made me feel well-balanced and gave me a sense of well-being.  You hear it all of the time, """"exercise is important"""".  I'll tell you, it is the only thing that helped me kick a serious bout of depression.

I think you may be experiencing something my cousin goes through. When her life is running smoothly; no confusion, no heartaches, no financial issues etc.. She will always find something to obsess about. She once said to me; """"I think I am freaking out because there is nothing wrong with my life now and it is like I am waiting for something to happen. Life can't be this good for long!"""" It is like she is waiting for something to foul up the comfort zone she has found herself in. She will """"look"""" for something to be worried about.

And humans make errors.  It is a known fact that the average delay in diagnosis of Endometriosis is 9 long years and takes over 5 physicians before a woman is given an answer to her pain.  Years of suffering in silence and being told it is in her head is a matter of course for most women and girls with Endo.  Therefore, you really need to be an empowered patient and educate yourself so that you can make the best choices for your case based on factual, timely information.  

It is wonderful to have a caring doctor in whom you have placed your trust, but doctors are not God and it is a known fact that there exists a disproportionate amount of erroneous info among many docs concerning this disease.  Just because someone is nice or means well, doesn't mean they can effectively treat the disease.

That said, there is an abundance of evidence-based and current info available in lay terms at www.endocenter.org.  You may wish to also speak with others by joining this support group at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/erc.

There is no definitive cure for Endometriosis, and a lot of the treatments are only temporarily, if it all, effective (and most come with side effects).  Your best bet is to find a surgeon who truly understands and treats only Endometriosis; surgical removal such as through excision can often afford an extremely high success rate for long-term relief and resolve of symptoms (versus medical therapy or superficial surgery like ablation, vaporization and other similar methods).  See www.centerforendo.com for more info on that.

You do not have to suffer.  While there is no cure, there are ways in which you can live well despite the disease.  Take an active role in your healthcare and you will do well.  Get the new book, """"Living Well with Endometriosis..."""" by Kerry Ann Morris (available at all bookstores and Amazon.com).  It is highly regarded in the Endo community and applauded by many healthcare professionals.

2657149,Do I Have an Eating Disorder?,"I don't eat much at all, especially at school. Whenever I do eat though I throw up. I am 175cm tall and weigh 54 kg but I don't see myself as thin, there's always somewhere I can lose weight. Occasionally I do excercise, I go for a 20 minute run every morning after I wake up.
I get dizzy and lose energy a lot too.

I'm too scared to tell my parents, and therefore can not see a doctor. I'm scared if I ask a teacher for help they'll tell my parents.
I don't know what to do. I don't think I'm so serious that I'm going to die, and I want to stay skinny, I'm just over the whole dizzy / no energy thing, as well as people telling me that my ribs are disgusting.

I've always been pretty thin though, and none of this started as a weight loss thing, it started because I just lost my appetite, every time I ate i'd get sick so i'd make myself throw up.

She has crippling arthritis. She has had it since I can remember. (I'm 19) However she also has a very very bad back. She has had several operations in the past 15 or so years, including a Spinal Fusion. However, lately due to the arthritis she has grown increasingly worse. It takes her 3 minutes to get out of the car.
She has been told that she now has 3 options. 

- Continue getting injections into her spine. (These only give about 2 weeks of relief)
- Epidural (these are very painful and last just 3 weeks) or
- Surgery on the plates which are trapping the nerves in her back (This is very serious surgey which could lead to paralysis)

I try to be supportive. My father is doing his best too, however I also have medical problems which I am finding difficult to come to terms with.
I am really worried about everything.
I don't want to talk to anyone as I am the type of person who bottles everything up and deals with one thing at a time, but this is really....","That cant be easy to deal with at all! especially because it is someone you care a lot about.

2246260,Advanced Throat Cancer?,"Ok, so my dad is 55, and approx 4 months ago was diagnosed with cancer. He's advanced as if he were to do the surgery, it would remove his voice box and leave him with both a breathing tube and a permanent stomach peg.  The last time he had any treatment was 3 weeks ago (he is scheduled to commence proper radiation/chemo on the 5th of december).  I guess i'm asking whether or not it is likely he will be ok?  I know that after the treatment he will be in remission, but what is the likely outcome.  I need to prepare myself, and my family for the most likely outcome :(  I know that each situation is different, which is why i'm not relying on statistics, but its seems that everything I read, it is likely the patient may last a few years after the treatment, but the best they can do is slow the cancer down, rather than rid the cancer cells, and leave him in remission.  Also - how likely is it that the cancer will spread within the next few weeks??

3428765,"For Parents Only, Please!! Does anyone have a child that has been diagnosed ADHD?","I thinking about taking my 7 yr old son to get tested for ADHD later this month. Last week I took my nieces to get shot and up on the wall was a list of symptoms for ADHD. And right away I thought of my son. Is it curable or just treatable? What things do they do at the evaluation? And what symptoms did your child have? My sons daydreams alot, he forgets when I just give him 1 task, he cant think on his homework, he gets angry and fustrated very easily. I thought all these things were pretty much common being a kid. To me I feel like he is hard on himself and i try everything to help him not to worry or be fustrated.I want to help him, but what should I do? What has worked for you and your child?","my son was diagnosed with adhd when he was in kindergarten.  I knew there was something wrong long before that but the Dr told me to wait until he was a little older. He also has been diagnosed with emotional disorder (bipolar) He was classified as having severe ADHD.  One thing I noticed right away was how hyper he was all the time. He couldn't handle any sort of stress. He would become irate if his routine changed even the littlest. He couldn't play with a group of children very long without becoming agitated or aggressive.  He couldn't follow simple tasks without being side tracked. He has his own space (which was big) and if it was invaded he would become aggressive and very upset.  He would become upset because he couldn't do the simple things other children around him were doing.  I spent several nights trying to help him learn his ABC's which would end in a huge crying session and him hitting himself.  In my case, my ex husband became the focus of some of his anger. He refuses to see him or talk to him because my ex would tease him about his problem.

My son's psychologist said that in some cases they can grow out of it.  (She has been a life saver and a big help in dealing with schools) In cases like my son where it is so severe and accompanied by a mental illness they will have to learn to live with it. It is easier to help them learn to live with it when it is caught young.

It is also a family issue.  Everyone will need to learn how to adjust and deal with the child.  They are not on the same wavelength as everyone else.  I've learned this over the last two years.  I have to deal with my daughter one way and my son another.

If your son is diganosed with ADHD, READ everything you can on it. Also, don't get just one oppionion. Try and get two.  They will give you and the school a test to fill out. Another thing is learn the law!!! It will come in handy.  I had to force a school to test my son so he could get an IEP. Even then you will have issues with the school.  Most schools are not equipped to deal with children like this and most educators don't have the patience or time to deal with them. 

I've been dealing with this for awhile.  I had to do alot of readjusting to help my son deal with this.

With that said:  



Hepatitis C is transmitted when the blood or body fluids from an infected person enters the body of a person who is not immune to the disease.

It can be spread by:

Having sex with an infected person without a condom (though experts don't know if condoms prevent transmission or just reduce it).
Sharing drugs and needles.
Being cut by infected needles (health care workers).
Birth from a mother to a child.
Hepatitis C is not spread through food, water, or by casual contact.

Unless you are sharing razors and bodily fluids with this guy, you are not in any danger.  You could hug him, kiss him, sit on his lap, hold his hand - all of these, all day long, and you would NOT get the disease.  

It is also not a form of HIV/AIDS, they are completely different diseases. 

I think it is wonderful that you would take someone in, but you should never do anything that you are not completely comfortable with.  You and your family are absolutely safe with this person unless you start sharing needles or having sex.  

I suggest going to www.webmd.com (i've included the link to a Hep C overview), www.wikipedia.org, and asking your family doctor for advice in order to make yourself absolutely comfortable.

There are a lot of people out here that would love to help you, but bulemia is way out of our scope of knowledge. You need a doctor regardless of whether he tells your parents or not. We're talking about your life here love, and I'm sure you don't want to die, do you? If you see a doctor, he can refer you to a councillor for your problems, and there is good anti-depressant medications out there, although that's not always the answer either. You should start by calling a kids help-line or something along those lines. Something anonymous where they don't even need to know your name. Then you need to find a doctor, then you need to find a good councillor.  You need to move rather quickly though, as it sounds like you're jaundiced (your yellowing skin), which means your liver is having trouble. Just take things one day at a time, or if you have to, one hour at a time. After you have something to eat, get out of the house immediately, go for a walk, put something else in your mind besides getting rid of the food.

I really do, I feel so bad for you. So, remember, take baby steps, but please, start taking them as soon as you can. Time is of the essence here. You can ask the doctor not to tell your parents, but why don't you tell them first. Tell them of the problems you are having. Tell them about your bulemia, then tell them you are very very unhappy, and that you need help. Haven't your parents noticed a difference in you? And as far as other people. They may mean well, but you have to stop listening to them. You need to listen to a professional. You have to start caring for yourself. Get a little selfish.

WHAT to eat for losing weight

 Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially NC (negative calorie) food.

* Print these lists. They will be your ... """"Bible"""", from now on !
* Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads. Also ognion + garlic.
* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)
* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.


 Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)

* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!
* Avoid fat meat


 Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!

 Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits

* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! 
* EVEN if they have """"low fat"""" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!


 About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!

* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.
* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!
* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). 

if u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs

1) It is not just the amount you eat, but what you eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.

2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle """"burn"""". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.

3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when you wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.

4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.

That is a good place to start... if you see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer 

Keep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hours
the most important thing is you don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you want

--Side Effects--Bupropion
Side effects that you should report to your prescriber or health care professional as soon as possible:
Uncommon:
ï¿½blurred vision
ï¿½difficulty breathing or wheezing
ï¿½fast or irregular heartbeat (palpitations)
ï¿½increased blood pressure
ï¿½hallucinations
ï¿½redness, blistering, peeling or loosening of the skin, including inside the mouth
ï¿½unusual tiredness or weakness
More common:
ï¿½agitation, anxiety, or restlessness, especially in the first week of treatment or when doses are changed
ï¿½confusion
ï¿½seizures
ï¿½skin rash, itching, hives
ï¿½vomiting

---CONCERTA---
ï¿½  Do not take methylphenidate if you have taken a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), or tranylcypromine (Parnate) in the last 14 days. 
 ï¿½  Do not take methylphenidate without first talking to your doctor if you have 
      ï¿½ an allergy to methylphenidate; 
      ï¿½ severe tension, agitation, or anxiety;

Is your brother taking bupropion for depression or another mental disorder? I found on a few web pages that state Concerta should not be taken if the patient has any type of depression or schizophrenia etc....

Also the the Tetracycline....

DRUG INTERACTIONS: It is recommended that tetracycline not be taken at the same time as aluminum-, magnesium-, or calcium- based antacids, such as Mylanta, Maalox, Tums, or Rolaids since, like food, these compounds bind tetracycline in the intestine. Similarly, tetracycline should not be taken with minerals (such as calcium or iron), with bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) or with dairy products.

Tetracycline may enhance the activity of warfarin (Coumadin) and result in excessive """"thinning"""" of the blood, necessitating a reduction in the dose of warfarin. Phenytoin (Dilantin), carbamazepine (Tegretol), and barbiturates (such as phenobarbital) can enhance the metabolism of tetracycline.

The signs and symptoms sound exactly like what you have described.

You usually discover that you have no vagina during puberty. Although you develop breasts and pubic hair, you do not start having periods. This is because the ovaries will produce the female hormones that make normal development occur but the absence of the uterus and vagina means that there is no period. Most of you report this when you are 15 or 16 years old.
However, some of you may have difficulties with having sex as your first problem.

What tests will I have?
Your GP will normally ask some questions and then examine you. Sometimes GPs feel that this examination is best done at a hospital by a gynaecologist and may refer you for this. During the examination, the doctor may discover that you have been born without a vagina.
Further investigations include:
 A blood test to check your chromosomes in order to exclude any other genetic abnormalities
 an ultrasound scan to confirm the absence of a womb but the presence of ovaries
As girls with this condition also have a 40% chance of having renal (kidney) problems or abnormalities, and 15% have a single kidney, a scan or X-ray of this area may also be recommended.

4035741,How long does she have...Living with progressive multiple sclerosis?,"My Aunt was diagnosed with MS over 20 years ago. In the past 7 years she has gotted really bad, she basically has every symptom of progressive MS. It's so hard to see her like this at the age of 57. The medication she is on doesn't really help her. She has no blatter control, can barely walk, very moody, cant remember things or keep a conversation going and can barely walk. So I wonder, how long she may have until we have to put her in a nursing home or worse death.","No one can pin point the exact t ime of death for anyone.  But I would say that your aunt is depressed.  Think about it she should be inthe prime of her life enjoying herself and she has zero control.  Unfortunately MS is a progressive disease without cure.  Just be there for her.  Make sure that she has someone to take care of her at home.  You DO NOT want her to go to a nursing home where she will get substandard care.  PLus that will depress her more.  Losing her home will be devastating.  Make sure that is she is bed ridden that she gets turned every hour and if she is in a wheel chair make sure that she lies down to relieve the pressure on her cocyx.  You do not want her getting sores otherwise she will have to go to a home.  If she doesnt have a catheter think about her getting one It would reduce the risk of urine burns to her thighs, buttox, and vagina.  Imagine if your freedom was taken this is what it is like for her loss of control.

They can help alot with different food plans to help you.

You're not used to eating and you have to start all over like a baby.  Start with a spoon of food, soft food, maybe oatmeal, every 2 hours, and slowly work up to a larger portion.  Eat just soft foods that are easy to digest.  Your electrolyte and hormones are probably way out of sync due to malnutrition so until you are able to eat better, you may have the mood swings and all.  You need to have potassium, maybe mash up or try to eat some bananas.  The bloating is because your body is storing gases and is not used to eating.  You just need to take it slow with small bites much like a baby when they are starting to eat solids.  Drink sips of water, don't try to swig down a glass.  Try an ounce or two with each spoonful of food.  Vary it, use fruit juices too instead of just water.

""""Paget's Disease of the Nipple

This type of breast cancer starts in the milk ducts and spreads to the skin of the nipple and areola (the dark circle around the nipple). The nipple and areola will often appear crusted, scaly and red. The patient may experience burning, itching or notice some bloody discharge from the nipple.

Paget's Disease is a rare form of breast cancer, occurring in only 1% of all cases. It can be associated with in situ carcinoma as well as invasive carcinoma. If no lump can be felt in the breast tissue and the biopsy shows the growth to be in situ and not invasive, treatment for Paget's Disease is very effective.""""

I want to know exact reasons of recession - whther it is too much brushing, bruxism (clenching of teeth - nightguard needed and how to measure bruxism?), alchohal, plaque deposits or anything else? and if I reduce all risks how long will it take for tooth loss to happen? currently I have almsot 4-5 mm of recession on outer side of all teeth while no recession at all on inside of teeth except for lower front teeth (which are mis-aligned and thus gather more plaque).

Not only can you see recession but you must do a periodontal exam to evaluate the bone levels, if you have pockets, you have lost more bone than you know (add recession+pocket depth= total loss of supporting structure).  I recommend, #1 see a dentist for a comprehensive exam and voice your concerns. #2 QUIT SMOKING (it increases your risk of periodontal disease). #3 Keep up with regual dental visits (often people with gum disease need to have cleanings and maintianance every 3-4 months). In most cases, someone as young as you are who practices good home care can reverse some of the loss or at least halt the disease in which case you could keep your teeth your entire life.  Recession can be caused by many of the things you mentioned, aggressive/improper bruhsing, brusxism, plaque and calculus (tartar) depostits.

Based on a study conducted on the various types of oregano, it was determined that these herbs were able to kill bacteria due to the heavy content of phenolic substances found in their cellular structure. 

Oregano, by connecting the free radicals released from the cells within its contents, is very healthy and improves the body's cell protection system. 

Oregano prevents the formation of cancer and diabetes and regulates the level of cholesterol. This characteristic prevents tumors and slows ageing of cells. 

Natural protector: 

As we all know, many additives are used to protect food against spoiling. Although scientists believe these chemical additives have no adverse effects on humans when used properly in correct amounts, they still recommend using natural preservatives. This is where oregano comes in. It is even possible to say the miracle of oregano is that, as a natural food preserver, it eliminates the adverse effects and risks that chemical additives have. 

For Warts or Boils: Saturate affected area(s). Cover with a bandage. Repeat dressing until lesions are clear.

The anti-flipflop articles say that b/c flip flops lack arch support your feet may get fallen arches. However many websites that encourage bare feet (which I also do a lot but only indoors) say that going barefoot can HELP strengthen your feet and develop good arches.

See the contradiction? Going barefoot and flip flops both have no arch support but barefoot can """"tone your feet"""" and flip flops will """"cause fallen arches"""". It makes no sense. I think flip flops is the closest you can get to natural barefoot walking without dirty feet and risk injury/infection. Can someone explain? Thanks!

So could I be pregnant or is it just pms?","If you have any of these pregnancy symptoms, and have missed your period be sure to take an at home pregnancy test, it is almost certain that you are pregnant!! 

A missed menstrual cycle can be a sign of pregnancy. It is usually the first indicator of pregnancy, although some women claim to know they are pregnant before they miss a period, since your period is not yet due, you should take the other points into consideration;

Tender swollen breasts are another early symptom. While tender breasts are a symptom of an impending menstrual cycle, swollen breasts are not. Sore and swollen breasts with a tingling sensation can be an early indicator of pregnancy;

Fatigue can be another indicator of pregnancy, especially if other symptoms are present. A nap a day can help a pregnant woman maintain normal daily activities.

It seems that you are experiencing most of these symptoms and only the missed period has not been experienced, simply because the date of your next period has not been reached.

I was going to wait to see if I got my period, which i did, but I know when you are on the pill, it is still possible to get your period.

you got yout period
and you dont experience symptoms till about 2 weeks after the egg implants itself. 

but if you didnt think you had a miscarriage then you should go tot he doc to see if anythign is left in there that could cause an infection that could lead to infertlity. but to me it just sounds like its side effects of the pill (if you are a few months new to it, your body is still adjusting, nausea, vomiting and breat tnderness are all side effects of the pill if you read the pamphlet.) never have unprotected sex either! the pill is not 100% effective and since you seem to not take them everyday then there is a decrease in effeciency of the pill protecting against pregnany. im on the pill and take it on time everyday and still use condoms even though i dont have to worry about std's cause we both lost ours to eachother, but we always use condoms just to protect against pregnancy just incase the condoms break the pill is really a back up method. 

go tot he doctor if you are still concerned. im sure you can talk tot he nurse and just get the answer over the phone but please prtect yourself! 

it is also if you are new to the pill that you bleed between periods. the symptoms of a miscarriage is heavy heavy bleeedin and severe cramps.

2834243,What is the best way to deal with mild to moderate depression that doesn't deal with anti-depresants(MAOI)?,"I have struggled with bouts of depression and isolation for as long as I can remember. I have seen the adverse affects of anti-depresants on my father and the way that he continued to struggle. I am a single man in my early 20's, who attends a university, and works for nearly everything he gets. I feel that there is always something missing and I;m getting tired of trying unsuccessfully to discover what it is. I have tried spirituality and I'm very active in my church but I feel unsatisfied. I have read extensively about depression and seasonal affective disorders and have come across too much information on the subject. I need the advice of you, the person reading this at this time. If you have suffered the affects of depression and have overcome without the use of perscription drugs-please tell me how you did it, or useful resourses that might help me. Thank you.","I understand your desire to stay away from """"sledgehammer"""" solutions. When it comes to your health, remedies that are stronger are not always better. I have three things that have gotten me through times when I've been depressed, and they're all gentle solutions that I think will suit an intelligent person like yourself. 

1 - The first is what Freud calls the """"talking cure"""". He insists that it must be performed by a psychoanalyst who you are paying for, but actually I've performed it by writing in a diary. The key is to be very honest, and try to find connections that you might otherwise be supressing, because these are the areas that need work. For example, what's the first thing that pops into your mind when you think of """"depression""""? If the answer is """"flying a kite"""", then follow the chain... What do you think of when you think of """"kite"""" and """"flying""""... You'll be surprised how quickly this takes you right down to an event in your childhood or an unresolved conflict that might have happened a year ago.

2 - Looking for lies. A chair cannot make you depressed. A lampshade cannot make you depressed. Only another person can make you depressed. I believe it is because a chair and a lampshade cannot lie. Only a person can lie. Depression, it seems to me, comes from believing a lie. That conflict (between reality and the lie) takes up so much mental energy to maintain, it drains you as a whole. You may find, after using technique #1, that it leads to you to this conclusion #2. For example, after free associating your way to an event, you might find that it was when someone told you that you weren't worth a hill of beans. The problem is not that they insulted you, the problem is that you believed the lie. Beware, giving up on a lie that we've believed in for a long time is tougher than it sounds.

3 - This one is going to sound goofy, especially after wading in deeply with the other two techniques. Get some light to shine on the cells in the back of your eyes. Go outside for an extended period of time without sunglasses (no need to stare at the sun or a light-bulb, indirect light will do). Use one of those gentle light therapy products like www.everlyte.com . Take a trip on a sailboat. Spend a few hours in open fields on sunny days. It's those cells in the eyes that produce much of the chemical that those pills seek to replace.",depression,,,NA,I have struggled with bouts of depression and isolation for as long as I can remember.,depression and isolation,,,,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,NA,NA,,What is the best way to deal with mild to moderate depression that doesn't deal with anti-depresants(MAOI)?,,,,,Not applicable

I started having severe headaches, stomach cramping, feeling like I was going to throw up, etc....I stopped taking it and started taking a normal multi-vitamin where it says 18mgs is the 100% needed each day, so my gawd, I was taking a LOT. This may seem strange, but while I was on that high dose, I started having light vaginal bleeding, but as soon as I stopped taking that high dose, the vaginal bleeding stopped. Has anyone ever heard of this as a side effect of taking way too much ferrous sulfate??? I know it can cause blood in your stools, so was wondering. Just seems to strange to just be a coincidence. Thanks for any input!!","If you are anemic, you need more than 18 mg of extra iron.  Your body needs much more iron.  Your doctor prescribed what he felt was best.  Also, there are different forms of iron and each one has different milligram dosage requirements for the same effect.  

There are other iron supplements available and in many price ranges.  I take the ferrous sulfate 325 mg now because it is cheap.  But, I do not like it as much as Niferex 150 Forte.  The Niferex with my insurance is $10 a month while the FS is $2 a month.  The Niferex 150 Forte and Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg. are supposed to be equivalent dosages.

When I first started taking Iron, I took the Niferex.  I had to use the ladies room every 45 minutes  for about what seemed like a week.  But, after that, I was normal.  The Niferex regulated me.  

The ferrous sulfate is okay.  But, I do not feel as good using it.  I also take it only every other day or so.  This is because it made me very constipated.  I think I did experience some of the side effects on a short term basis.  I never had the extra vaginal bleeding.  

I am anemic because I had about 15 years of severe periods due to Polycystic Ovararian Syndrome.  So, the extra iron may be beneficial for someone to have a normal period which may account for your light vaginal bleeding.  

I am now back on the Niferex because I felt so much better using it.  I know I said that I take the FS now because it is cheap.

You do not always have esophageal burning. He needs a Ph probe or a Nasopharyngoscopy to completely rule out GERD.

Symptoms: frequent cough or clearing of throat, always feeling something in your throat, burning feelin in throat. sore throat, hoarseness/change in voice possibly, if GERD is severe acid may bubble over into the trachea causing asthma like symptoms

Treatments within your control other than medication are:
Don't eat right before bedtime
Decrease alcohol, coffee, and chocolate consumption. Lose weight(if that is an issue), Don't wear tight fitting clothes. Don't eat acidic food citrus fruits, tomato sauce etc. Raise the head of your bed 30-45 degrees.

For 5 years now, the pain is getting progressively worse.  Currently, I have excruciating pain in my mouth, I am having increasing difficulty breathing and swallowing and this is getting critical since I am wheezing with each breath.  I have very serious underlying health problems that include multiple congenital heart problems and Hepatitis C contracted via a blood transfusion.

I cannot eat without being in almost unbearable pain.  This pain is NOT caused by my teeth but by the ï¿½strandsï¿½ of slimey, writhing things that have ï¿½hooksï¿½ that pierce my upper palette, lips and tongue. These ï¿½strandsï¿½ come up my throat into my mouth and nose. 

I have been to many infectious disease doctors and dentists who diagnosed everything from ï¿½in my headï¿½ to dry mouth (Sjorgrenï¿½s syndrome).  These conditions, along with neuralgia, were subsequently ruled out and I told the by the doctors that they did not know the cause of my complaints.  The only treatment that ï¿½workedï¿½ was when I treated for the giardia lamblia parasite.  The anti-parasitic medicine for that did start to affect this parasite. But it was not the correct medication.

If so, don't worry.  The natural progression from pre-cancerous cells to actual cancer of the cervix can take 5 to 15 years.  Make sure you get treatment and a follow-up smear.  Secondly, the inflammation of cells on your cervix caused by the gonorrhoea could be mistaken for pre-cancerous cells.  What you probably need is treatment for the infection followed by a repeat smear 6 months from now.  Your doctor may also want you to attend a coloposcopy clinic to have a closer look at your cervix.  The only way this could effect your future pregnancies is if you need a cone biopsy of the cervix which is unlikely from what you have told me.
With regard to the infection, any infection effecting the pelvic organs can effect your chances of getting pregnant and increases your risk of an ectopic pregnancy.  That said, lots of women have infections for years and still have no problems at all. Worse case scenario is you have difficulty getting pregnant but then IVF treatment nowadays would solve your problem and has good success rates.

2935733,Miscarriage?,"Ok I miscarried the end of last month.  I was told that we need to becareful and wait three months before TTC again. 

Signs of pregnancy subsided. We haven't been as careful as we should have been. I haven't had my period yet. And now,  I am having pms/pregnancy signs again. 

Hypothetically speaking when can a woman get pregnant again?
  
When can I expect my period again? 

Can you get pregnant before your next period, after the miscarriage? Don't you need to ovulate before you have your period? In order to have a period you need to expel blood/old egg...right? I don't understand how this works (In regards to a miscarriage and resuming normal function)

I think it's just PMS, but it's something I want to know. I will be careful going forward...I, of course, want a healthy baby so I am going to way the 3 months.  (This was my first baby/miscarriage)","When i miscarried my period came the very next month when it was due.
your health after miscarriage 

HCG Levels
Most women can expect their levels to return to a non-pregnant range about 4 - 6 weeks after a pregnancy loss has occurred. This can differentiate by how the loss occurred (spontaneous miscarriage, D&C procedure, abortion, natural delivery), and how high the levels were at the time of the loss.
Health care providers usually will continue to test HCG levels after a pregnancy loss to ensure they return back to 5.0. 

tiredness
It is normal to feel emotionally and physically drained following a miscarriage. If possible take a few days off work, and if you can't, make sure you get to bed early, plan rests where possible and postpone anything that isn't urgent.
Make yourself your first priority. 

bleeding
If your miscarriage is complete, you can expect your bleeding to taper off rapidly, i.e. over the next week it should get lighter and lighter and stop. All bleeding and spotting should have stopped by seven days. If it persists or is heavier than a normal period, this indicates something is wrong, see your doctor. While you are still bleeding it is important that you shower, not bath, and that you do not swim in public pools because of the risk of contracting an infection.

pain
When the miscarriage is complete, or after a D&C all pain should cease. Again, see your doctor if you have continuing pain.

temperature
Temperature indicates infection which can result in infertility. If you have one see your doctor urgently. You will be treated with antibiotics and possibly a D&C (or repeat D&C). 

discharge
If you are having an offensive discharge this could also indicate infection so get checked out. 

lactation
This is normal if the pregnancy has lasted longer than 12 weeks and will stop by itself. 

menstrual cycle
Ovulation can occur 14 days after a miscarriage with the next period 28 days after the miscarriage, but there is great personal variation. It may take a few cycles before your regular pattern is re-established. This means that you can become pregnant 14 days after a miscarriage if you resume a normal cycle immediately, but there is a great personal variation. It can take up to 6 or 7 weeks for your next period to come if you had """"natural"""" miscarriage (i.e. no D&C or tablets). 

sex
Sexual intercourse should be avoided until bleeding has stopped to prevent the risk of infection. Even though your cervix will be closed again, sperm can travel up through it and introduce infection into the uterus, which is still healing. 

contraception
If you do not wish to become pregnant immediately, you should start using contraception straight after the miscarriage. Note: The pill should be commenced at the time of the miscarriage. You will not be safe until you have taken the tablets for 14 days. 

the physical symptoms of grief
Many women find they experience physical symptoms of grief as well as the emotional aspects. These vary greatly from person to person, and include: 
disturbed sleep and eating patterns 
unexplainable tiredness 
unexpected tears 
disturbing dreams and mental confusion

Be gentle and patient with yourself during this time and take comfort in knowing that these symptoms are normal.

You can get pregnant right away...you are more fertile after you have a miscarriage or giving birth.

Even though I've never really been 'diagnosed' with depression, I deffinitely know its worse them most peoples. I just hate making a big deal about things. Earlier this year I tried to kill myself, but when my therapist asked if I needed to be committed, I declined.. because I just don't want to be a problem to people.. Do you think that mental health disorders are real? ADHD, is that just a kid who doesn't listen and needs his ass beaten, like my dad says. Depression, is that just someone who makes themselves depressed, as he says as well? Even though I know he's OCD and so am I, so why would he accept that?","Yes , mental disorders are real. Ask yourself this: If it's possible to have a heart disorder of some kind, then why would it not be possible for the brain to have disorders? The problem with the brain disorders is that they manifest themselves through behavior most times. Unlike most physical ailments that manifest themselves through some physical illness/disability/failure. Since behavior is not physical in nature it is hard for some to understand that there is indeed a real physical problem with the brain. It makes me angry that your father could be so ignorant, at best he'll do you no good, at worst he could possibly harm you by his careless misunderstanding of mental illness.

ADHD is very real as well, kids don't make that up, it would be too difficult for a child to manage faking such an illness.

Depressed people don't """"make"""" themselves depressed, again, it comes from a chemical (real physical) imbalance in the brain that manifests itself through behavior, thought, and emotions.

I think your father is narrow minded and chooses to remain ignorant when it would be easy enough to educate himself about these things on the internet. Ignorance by choice is simple stupidity. Since mental illness by it's very nature is intangable, I think many people do not have either the capacity to understand or simply choose to remain ignorant because to truly understand mental illness takes quite a bit of clarity of thought and understanding. The tangible is much easier to deal with as it's right there before your eyes, you see the effects, whereby with mental illness you feel the effects and it's inherent side effects it has on your behavior and thought processes, but there's nothing to put your hands on, nothing to see.

I do know how you feel.  Unfortunately there is not much you can do aboout this particular cold sore.  But there is something you can do in the future.  

The cold sore virus is from the same family of viruses that causes genital herpes.  Once you have the cold sore virus it is always in your body.  It comes out in times of stress or when your immune system is a bit weak, such as now when you are sick, or if you get too much sun, or if you are very anxious about something.

I don't know how old you are so I don't know if you can sort this yourself.  There is a prescription medication called Valtrex that attacks the cold sore virus.  It was actually developed for genital herpes, but it works wonderfully for the cold sore virus too.  YOu take it at the first tingle of a cold sore and it stops the cold sore in its tracks and stops it from developing.  I used to get cold sores badly.  My family doc prescribed this medication about 5 years ago, and since the first time I took it I haven't had a bad cold sore.  YOu don't have to take it all the time - only for a day or two when you first feel the tingle of a cold sore.  YOu don't have to take the whole prescription as you would if it was for gential herpes.  

I would not consider any other treatment now that I see how effectively this one has worked for me.  The otehr things you see advertised for cold sores do not actually attack the virus - they just help soothe the symptoms.

I endured years of endometriosis and if the endometriosis is so severe as to require so many pain pills ... it may be best to seek another alternative treatment.

As with any assumptions, it is wrong to assume that she is giving false information to her physicians unless of course you have positive proof of this.  Yet, with an addiction to prescribed pain medications it is very possible that one will exaggerate the intensity of their pain and/condition to further their cravings for the drug.  She also may be taking prescriptions that have conflicting effects which could be causing her drowsiness as well as many other problems.

I slept with my boyfriend the other day, and was unaware of any blisters that were present until a while after having sex, my boyfriend then said that the condom had split in the process.. Does this mean he would have definately caught something, or is it a chance that he might not have.

Just because he wore a condom doesn't mean that he didn't catch herpes Whether you have symptoms or not, you can still transmit the infection. If you are sexually active, condoms can help reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk of spreading HSV.

Genital herpes (also called HSV infection) is a viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that may cause skin blisters and sores in the genital area, but often causes no visible symptoms. It is possible to get genital herpes through sexual contact with an infected person even if he or she has no symptoms.

 ARTHRITIS - OSTEOARTHRITIS/ RHEUMATOID
 
 
Arthritis is inflammation of one or more joints, usually accompanied by pain, stiffness, swelling, loss of function and over time, changes in structure. Arthritis is associated with many diseases including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus erythematosus, Lyme disease, psoriasis, scleroderma, Reiter's syndrome, Sjogren's syndrome, and ankylosing spondylitis.

Symptoms
Osteoarthritis, usually found in elderly people, develops mainly as a result of the continuous wearing away of the cartilage in a joint. It is the most prevalent form of arthritis. It is characterised by pain and stiffness (especially after exercise), swelling, deformity, and/or a diminished range of motion. 
Bone growths or spurs may develop on the margins of affected joints, increasing pain and decreasing mobility. There may be audible cracking or grating noises when the joint moves. 

Rheumatoid arthritis causes stiffness (especially in the mornings), swelling, and, often, crippling pain. It may also cause fatigue, anaemia and weight loss. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder: it is a """"self-attacking-self"""" disease. The body's immune system improperly identifies the synovial membranes as foreign. Inflammation results, damaging cartilage and tissues in and around the joints. Normal spaces within the joints become narrowed and the bones may even fuse together.

Causes
The causes of osteoarthritis can be injury or an inherited defect in the protein that forms cartilage. Mostly, it is a result of the wear and tear related to ageing, diet and lifestyle. Risk factors include obesity, overuse or abuse of joints as in sports or strenuous occupations, and trauma.

The underlying cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown.

Natural Therapies
The application of proper diet, and lifestyle changes, combined with nutritional supplements may relieve the inflammation, pain and slow-down degeneration of the affected joints.
Glucosamine- Clinical trials show that glucosamine may help reduce joint inflammation and swelling, increase joint mobility and provide temporary relief of the pain of osteoarthritis. 
Blackmores Lyprinolï¿½ is a natural anti-inflammatory supplement containing a unique patented marine extract. Its potent anti-inflammatory action assists in the maintenance of healthy airways and breathing passages, and may provide relief from joint swelling and arthritis.
Fish Oil 1000 contains omega-3 fatty acids which provide an anti-inflammatory action within the body which may be beneficial for the relief of inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis
 
 Important Notes

If you suspect you are suffering from arthritis, prompt diagnosis will help to determine the type, and therefore, the right treatment and prevention. 

Food allergies may be a cause for some individuals especially if there is only occasional joint pain. An elimination diet, or allergy diet, may be necessary to determine which foods are the offending allergens.

Arthritis is sometimes described as just a symptom of an underlying condition. If you are suffering from arthritis, it is imperative to investigate the health of all the different systems of the body, especially the health of the digestive, circulatory and immune systems. Arthritis is a complex, and also very individual condition requiring individual attention.



Prevention

Exercise is important in both the prevention and treatment of arthritis . It improves muscle strength and maintains mobility.

Overweight and obesity also affect the weight bearing joints, which become irritated and stressed by having to carry too much of a load.

Correct posture is also important in avoiding body weight to be distributed unevenly, and causing stiffness and crippling.

650153,Where can I find information on the results of a bipolar person refusing medication?,I'm trying to gather info for a stepparent adoption and my ex has bipolar disorder and refuses to take any medication.  There have been stays in the psych ward and suicide attempts.  My son is autistic and I believe it to be in his best interest if the bio father's rights were terminated.  There has been no contact for almost a year.  My son has problems with routine changes (symptom of autism) and having a bio father pop in and out of his life could be harmful.,"Wow.   I don't know about professional info but I can give you my experience which is kind of the opposite of yours.   My husband is Bi-polar and has only spent a total of 3 months on medication in the last 3 years since he was diagnosed.  I have known him for 14 years (since we were kids) so I have seen a lot of the progressions of this disease.  

My son has ADHD and emotional/psychological issues with changes in his routine (I understand this is more severe with autism).  There have been some problems when my husband has been manic and it disrupts our home-life, and then the hospital stays, yes I am familiar with those stresses.

My husband tried various medications after hospitalization but didn't like them and never gave them time to work.  However now his on Lithium and doing well with his therapy.

Now to turn the tables...
If your ex refuses medication he will likely never be able to provide any stable support.  You probably know this already.  If his past behavior shows a pattern of irrationality, instability and especially if he has attempted suicide then most courts would agree that he could potentially pose a threat to your son.  If your pediatricial would be able to put into writing that your son requires an absolute routine and that his fathers symptoms of the uncontrolled bopolar disorder are too disruptive then that should be enough to atleast get a hearing.  

Look into the standard step-parent adoption to get started (it is much easier than a traditional adoption).  If you think your ex might possibly sign-off on an uncontested adoption I would try that.  If he is more likely to fight you on it then use the information that you know from his past issues as a basis for your arguement.  

Sorry I can't give you more info...this sort of thing varies from State to State.

So to the nay-sayers who think we should let our kids run the streets nowadays..... I point to the kids who've died in the streets, been molested, abused, etc.  None of that happened to my kids, so they should just back up off of it.

*Seeked & recieved medical attention (chicopractor) for 2-3+ years

*Pain continued & has persisted 6+ years, but has gotten better

*Recent car crash has completely deminished any progress & pain is almost unbareable

*No moved or slipped disks, etc..

*Extreme pain in entire back- from top to bottom

*Muscles & nerves very tense & tight","Tough question.  Its a personal decision.

First off, if there is no slipped disk or nerves being pinched or associated weakness and numbness  in extremities, what exactly is the back surgeon going to fix??  I mean I doubt back surgery of any type is going to take away the pain from ""top to bottom.""

I think the following are the factors that you need to think about:

1)Neurological symptoms like leg numbness or weakness, compromised walking.  These symptoms can progress over time and you may not get function back if you wait to long.  Usually there is an identifiable lesion like a slipped disk pushing on a nerve on MRI.

2)Chronic back pain that is amenable to surgery.  For instance anterolithesis or posterolithesis where the vertebral body is slipped forward or backwards.  In conditions like these the pain may became unbearable (this is where personal choice is important) and you can't stand it any longer that surgery is the only option.

3)What does the back surgeon say?  Its important to seek the consult of multiple back surgeons that are reputable. Sometimes, more often then not, back surgery results in more pain and disability.  Some people often have 1 surgery after the next to fix the problems from the previous surgeon.  If 3 surgeon says its not fixable and 1 says they can help I would trust the first 3 surgeons.

4)You have exhausted all your option.  Chiropractors, medications, physical therapy, alternative medicine, massage therapy, accupucture, yoga.

My sense, again is if you have pain from ""top to bottom"" surgery isn't going to help.  If there is no identifiable cause of this pain, surgery will not improve your situation.  A chronic pain specialist have actually be more helpful.",back surgery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,How is that decision made??,Yes: Tough question.  Its a personal decision.
1966769,How much does diabetes impair your lifestyle?,"I'm not trying to offend anyone, but I was just wondering how different your life would be if you are diagnosed.

I'm sorry if this is 25 questions in one, but if you could answer this, it would help a lot.

Does the disease take over your life?
Can you still be active and athletic?
Can you still eat the occasional junkfood?
Does it screw up your sexual life and stuff?
Can you still have kids?
Do the symptoms of the disease go away after you are diagnosed? (ie. Will you still feel thirsty all of the time?)

Can someone tell me the lifestyle differences between Type 1 and Type 2?
I know that they are different, but is one easier to live with than the other?

Will you most likely die from the disease? What will your life expectancy be?

I just want some information on the disease, and I would appreciate it if someone could help me.","My life would be infinitely better if I had not been diagnosed with Type I diabetes at age five. More than anything, I try not to let it control my life or even think about it when I'm not preparing my insulin or testing my blood-sugar. I know I'll pay for that some day, but I would rather live a fuller life now.

I'm not really going mention Type IIs because I don't care; they screwed themselves and are not my problem. Their type is just a lifestyle disorder, not like with Type I, which is a genetic/auto-immune disorder.

Type I diabetics can be active, but we generally don't see the positive gains from such a lifestyle (weight loss, increased energy) than non-diabetics do. 

I eat junk food sometimes, but not high-sugar junk food. Mostly, I like sugar-free, low fat ice cream bars. Yum. Sugar-free pudding is awesome too.

For women, it doesn't serious effect their sexual functioning until pretty late in the game. The trouble is mainly finding a partner who can accept some of the limitations that diabetes places on them, like not wanting to risk a pregnancy. Personally, I would commit suicide before going through the hell of a diabetic pregnancy. I watched a friend's sister going through the worst sort of hell before dying at the end of her pregnancy. Not worth it!

For men, the sexual side effects can be devastating. At some point, they become completely unable to have or maintain an erection. It's much worse for diabetic men with Type II because they are also battling obesity and high blood pressure, much of the time at least.

As for kids, yes, diabetics can still have children; however, if the woman is the effected partner, then she would have to be willing to die or go through the rest of her life blind or with severely damaged kidneys. I'll reiterate: NOT WORTH IT.

Some of the symptoms go away with good control, including the thirst and excessive urination. Good control is almost impossible to maintain without surrendering your entire life to the disease.

Most likely, I will die in my early fifties from complications from the disease. If I had to guess which, I would say from cardio-vascular complications because heart ailments run in my family; I'm double-dipping, so to speak. Of course, I could be hit by a car tomorrow while having a blood-sugar level of 100, because really, no one knows. Each diabetic is different.

He writes that  by maximizing and keeping in balance the Oxalic acid in our bodies, we can maintain an immune system capable at keeping all forms of cancer out of our bodies, as well as shrink existing cancers now present in your body.  He list a number of baddies, called blockers which will and can totally drain the Oxalic Acid out of our bodies in less than an hour, and suggest that we totally avoid these blockers at all cost but particularly if you are sick with any malady. Ever hear of this before on any topic of discussion concerning this chemical substance? The chemical based compound which is imported into this country is used primarily as an ethching agent to clean things such as radiators. But the Oxalic Acid Col. joe is refering to occurs and is found in our diet, primarily dark leafy veggies.","Whatever Colonel Joe calls Oxalic Acid may or may not be what Wikapedia calls Oxalic Acid. I listened to Col Joe on a radio show and he claimed that fresh juiced carrot was the best source of oxalic acid. Carrot Juice may contain trace amounts of oaxalic acid but there is a lot more going on with carrots that makes it a wonderful juice when added to one's daily diet.

As far as Colonel Joe's stand on Vitamin C, I can see how it relates to Oaxalic Acid but I couldn't disagree more about Vitamin C's health benefits. Vitamin C is a first rate healing vitamin as proven by hundreds of double blind placebo controlled studies.

As far Vitamin B-6 goes, I believe there needs to be a balance of B-Vitamins if B Vitamins are being used as a supplement

In any case, I believe Colonel Joe has had great success from helping hundreds of chronically ill people looking for a way to overcome Cancer and other deadly diseases. There are many directions to the same place and perhaps Colonel Joe's healing modality works just fine. There are many good things on Colonel Joe's list of good things to eat. If you get enough of those good foods then you might not need those foods with Vitamin C and B-6.

Teens and up to 25yr olds produce enough from the pituitary gland. It's only as we age pass this, does production slow down. It does'nt stop though - people who work out hard and regular show increased levels in comparison to others. 

There is no evidence to date that if you supplement, then stop - your natural production will decrease further because of the 'un-natural' supplementation.

My question is, what is the basic principal of eating as a diabetic?  Is there an amount of protein/carbs/fat that one should eat to maintain a constant glucose level in the blood?  Or a specific timing?  

Thank you so much for your help.","Limit your carb intake. The body turns all carbs into sugar. With simple carbs; sugar, honey, syrup, etc. the body converts these quickly causing your blood sugar to spike so avoid these. Complex carbs like rice, oatmeal, beans, etc. take longer to convert so your blood sugar doesn't spike, but it will still go up. You also have to be careful not to eat too much protein. Protein won't effect your blood sugar, but will effect your kidneys which are already working overtime trying to get rid of the excess sugar. Make an appointment and talk with a dietitian. In the meantime practice portion control. That's where most of us get in trouble. 1/2 Cup is a serving of starch like corn, beans, pasta, potatoes. 1 Cup is a serving of raw veggies and 1/2 Cup cooked veggies = a serving. 1 oz. of meat = 1 serving of meat. Watch your diet and talk with a dietitian and you should be able to control your diabetes without having to go on meds.

He has gone thru depressive phase as well. he is on 2mg respideral these days. He was prescribed various other medications in the beginning as well . Presently he is practicaly not doing anything. He also regulary visits Psychiatrist. Her overall assessment is that he is a kind of Schizophrtenic. He also addicterd on Cannabis.
Please advise how can we develop/incease his interest in a job/small business at least.","Tough situation as lack of motivation is a symptom of schizophrenia. It sounds as if he may have a somewhat complex symptom picture including both depression and schizophrenia symptoms. Don't know what he was like before developing symptoms of psychosis, but if he has always tended to be shy, or amotivated then schizophrenia makes these traits more pronounced.

At any rate, it may be that making the jump to a job or studies is too big a jump to make right now. It is also often difficult for you as a parent to be the one who motivates your adult child with a mental illness. I would suggest looking in your community for a community program that would involve your son in some activities that might be a precursor to job/studies. Psychosocial rehabilitation, day treatment, and other rehabilitation programs can be quite helpful. Call your local mental health association, ask your psychiatrist, or call the local mental health center for a referral to a rehabilitation program. 

Hang in there as this is a long-term problem with which you must deal. Ideally you would like to have your child work his way to more independance, but it might be a slow journey. Get some help from people who know how to do this. You might also find out if there is a support group for parents with schizophrenic children--these groups can be very helpful in providing information and support.

241434,Probability of spreading oral herpes?,"I have had fever blisters ever since i was little.  I've always been unsure of how contagious they are, and now I get the impression I could spread them to anybody I have intimate physical contact with.  Are they so contagious, even *without* an outbreak, that i need to tell everybody I've ever kissed before that they could potentially be spreading oral herpes as well as to other areas?  My fever blisters heal in two days with medication.  Is the healing time that quick for genital herpes?

People with a medical background answering this question would be more helpful...Thanks!","I am sorry to say but Mike is WRONG:
There are two types of Herpes,  Herpes simplex type I or II. Either type can infect the mouth or genitals (if you're really unlucky you can have 4 lifelong infections going at the same time: HSV1 and 2 in the upper body, HSV1 and 2 in the lower body. This would be very rare). When your incfected, the virus """"hides"""" in the nervous system between outbreaks. It will protect you from a new infection of the same type, not of another type.
Only about 25% of Americans over the age of 12 DO NOT have antibodies against one of the two (standard test for exposure and infection).
HSV1 is extremely prevalent (very easy to pass on, quite innocently, just by an injudicious kiss to a baby). Most everybody (up to 90% of the population) has antibodies against HSV1 by the time they're 50.
About 20 to 30% of the population has antibodies against HSV2, more women than men (infection is easier for females), but HSV1 is fast becoming a major cause of genital herpes.
Most people with HSV1 have just """"fever blisters"""". Some have it bad, a terrible rash from the nose down to the chest, inside the mouth, it looks like a case of pox. It can last a few days to over a week. Genital herpes is basically the same on the genitals, blisters and lesions, individually different how bad. 

Now about transmission: It mostly happens when you have a blister/blisters going, through direct skin-to-skin contact. Avoid physical contact with the area from the time of the first symptoms (tingling, itching, burning) until all sores are completely healed, not just scabbed-over. Also try to prevent self-infection to other areas of your body. Wash your hands with soap and water if you touch a sore. Better yet, don't touch the sores.
Unfortunately, the virus can sometimes  spread , when no signs or symptoms are present. This is called """"Asymptomatic Transmission."""" Often people don't know they are infected, these people may have symptoms so mild they don't notice them at all or else don't recognize them as herpes. They can also spread it. Still, asymptomatic transmission appears to be far less likely than spreading the virus when lesions are present.",oral herpes,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,Yes,Yes: Probability of spreading oral herpes?,,,,,Not applicable

Tamitha","Acute pelvic pain is pain that starts over a short period of time anywhere from a few minutes to a few days. This type of pain is often a warning sign that something is wrong and should be evaluated promptly. 
Pelvic pain can be caused by an infection or inflammation. An infection doesn't have to affect the reproductive organs to cause pelvic pain. Pain caused by the bladder, bowel, or appendix can produce pain in the pelvic region; diverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome, kidney or bladder stones, as well as muscle spasms or strains are some examples of non-reproductive causes of pelvic or lower abdominal pain. Other causes of pelvic pain can include pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), vaginal infections, vaginitis, and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). All of these require a visit to your healthcare provider who will take a medical history, and do a physical exam which may include diagnostic testing. 

Women who have ovarian cysts may experience sharp pain if a cyst leaks fluid or bleeds a little, or more severe, sharp, and continuous pain when a large cyst twists. Fortunately, most small cysts will dissolve without medical intervention after 2 or 3 menstrual cycles; however large cysts and those that don't rectify themselves after a few months may require surgery to remove the cysts. 

An ectopic pregnancy is one that starts outside the uterus, usually in one of the fallopian tubes. Pain caused by an ectopic pregnancy usually starts on one side of the abdomen soon after a missed period, and may include spotting or vaginal bleeding. Ectopic pregnancies can be life-threatening if medical intervention is not sought immediately. The fallopian tubes can burst and cause bleeding in the abdomen, if left untreated. In some cases surgery is required to remove the affected fallopian tube.",pelvic pain?,35-44 years old,Female,NA,,,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,.anyone have any idea what it might be,,,,,Not applicable

4301681,Redness of skin in nose.?,For about three months now I have had redness of my skin where my nostrils connect to my upper lip. It doesn't itch or cause me any pain. I put neosporin on it each night when I go to bed and it doesn't seem to clear it up at all. My mom believe it is a viral infection and I should go to a dermotologist to have it check out. I don't blow/itch/pick my nose constantly so I don't think I am causing the irritation. Anyone have any ideas?,"i had something similar once...it just turned out to be super dry skin, no matter how much i moisturized it.  after 3 and a half months, it eventually went away on its own...RIGHT before my trip to the derm...ugh.

so, if the skin is very dry (i.e.  big flakes of skin can slough off) along with the redness, it could be a form of what causes dandruff on the scalp of adults and 'cradle-head' on the heads of babies...if so, you'll need a prescription lotion. (AmLactin...or something in the same area)

though, i'm definitely not a doctor...in which case, you should make an appt. with a dermatologist to get it checked out for sure.

3595819,Can high blood pressure medication cause nervous system side effects?,"I am taking a high blood pressure medication, and it seems/appears that since I have been taking the medication I have had headaches all over, dizziness/light headedness, numbness in parts my face, as well as a stiff neck. These symptoms arent consisently there, maybe 1-2 times a day for an hour or so. Can a high blood pressure medication cause such or is this some unrelated condition that I should seek out?","Possible Side Effects of Drugs That Lower Blood Pressure
Some of the drugs listed below can affect certain functions of the body, resulting in bad side effects. However, drugs that lower blood pressure have proven effective over the years. The benefits of using them far outweigh the risk of side effects. Most people whoï¿½ve taken these drugs havenï¿½t had any problems.

Diuretics ï¿½ Some of these drugs may decrease your body's supply of a mineral called potassium. Symptoms such as weakness, leg cramps or being tired may result. Eating foods containing potassium may help prevent significant potassium loss. You can prevent potassium loss by taking a liquid or tablet that has potassium along with the diuretic, if your doctor recommends it. Diuretics such as amiloride (Midamar), spironolactone (Aldactone) or triamterene (Dyrenium) are called """"potassium sparing"""" agents. They donï¿½t cause the body to lose potassium. They might be prescribed alone but are usually used with another diuretic. Some of these combinations are Aldactazide, Dyazide, Maxzide or Moduretic.

Some people suffer from attacks of gout after prolonged treatment with diuretics. This side effect isn't common and can be managed by other treatment.

In people with diabetes, diuretic drugs may increase the blood sugar level. A change in drug, diet, insulin or oral antidiabetic dosage corrects this in most cases. Your doctor can change your treatment. Most of the time the degree of increase in blood sugar isn't much. Impotence may also occur in a small percentage of people.

Beta-blockers ï¿½ Acebutolol (Sectral), atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Lopressor), nadolol (Corgard), pindolol (Visken), propranolol (Inderal) or timolol (Blocadren) may cause insomnia, cold hands and feet, tiredness or depression, a slow heartbeat or symptoms of asthma. Impotence may occur. If you have diabetes and youï¿½re taking insulin, have your responses to therapy monitored closely.

ACE inhibitors ï¿½ These drugs, such as captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), lisinopril (Zestril or Prinivil), may cause a skin rash; loss of taste; a chronic dry, hacking cough; and in rare instances, kidney damage.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers ï¿½ These drugs may cause occasional dizziness.

Calcium channel blockers ï¿½ Diltiazem (Cardizem), nicardipine (Cardene), Nifedipine (Procardia) and verapamil (Calan or Isoptin) may cause palpitations, swollen ankles, constipation, headache or dizziness. Side effects with each of these drugs differ a great deal.

Alpha blockers ï¿½ These drugs may cause fast heart rate, dizziness or a drop in blood pressure when you stand up.

Combined alpha and beta blockers ï¿½ People taking these drugs may experience a drop in blood pressure when they stand up.

Central agonists ï¿½ Alpha methyldopa (Aldomet) may produce a greater drop in blood pressure when you're in an upright position (standing or walking) and may make you feel weak or faint if the pressure has been lowered too far. This drug may also cause drowsiness or sluggishness, dryness of the mouth, fever or anemia. Male patients may experience impotence. If this side effect persists, your doctor may have to change the drug dosage or use another medication.

Clonidine (Catapres), guanabenz (Wytensin) or guanfacine (Tenex) may produce severe dryness of the mouth, constipation or drowsiness. If you're taking any of these drugs, donï¿½t stop suddenly, because your blood pressure may rise quickly to dangerously high levels.

Peripheral adrenergic inhibitors ï¿½ Reserpine may cause a stuffy nose, diarrhea or heartburn. These effects aren't severe and no treatment is required other than to change the amount of drugs taken. If you have nightmares or insomnia or get depressed, tell your doctor. You should stop using the drugs.

1519275,Cryotherapy effects on fertility?,"Last year my pap came back abnormal. My OBGYN is offering cryotherapy to treat the cervical dysplasia (mild). I haven't been able to find any info about whether or not it can affect fertility. We really want a 2nd child, so I've been withholding on making a decision about cryotherapy. My dysplasia is NOT hpv related, if it would have been, my doctor would have told me. They don't know the cause of my dysplasia, but after a year it has not resolved by itself.  Can having cryotherapy affect my fertility later on and if so...what are the chances that it could?","No, there have been plenty of women who've had cryotherapy and gone on to have children.  If it has any effect at all, it will be on the cervix' ability to efface and dialate during delivery, or it may dialate too easily beforehand.  If it looks as if it will dialate early, the ob can easily perform a procedure called cerclage where a stitch is put in to hold it closed.  If it doesn't thin and dialate properly during labor, you would require a c-section, of course.  But it will not affect your abilty to get pregnant in the first place.  The doctor treating you will be the best person to ask as far as timing for a second pregnancy, to give you time to heal properly after the cryotherapy.  The procedure will scar the cervix permanently, and any OB you see will notice it.  They will need to know all your prior medical history, and will probably keep a close eye on you during the pregnancy to watch for early dialation.   It's not an uncommon procedure for treating this type problem, and the sooner you have it done, the less invasive it will need to be- less scaring on the cervix in the end.  Also, it will help possibly prevent the need for a more major surgery which could preclude a second pregnancy.  I'd say have a good talk with the OB-GYN and tell him/her your concerns.  They can help give you more information and assurances than anyone here.  But for your own peace of mind in the meantime- no it doesn't keep you from getting pregnant. My own sister had the procedure at 25 and went on to have two healthy girls.

1835925,How long should it take a 'runner's knee' injury to heal?,"Since starting school, I have been trying different exercise routines to stay reasonably active.  I used to use my stepper religiously, but after a day of study I need some fresh air so running a bit seemed to be just the thing.  Well, I think it has caused runner's knee and am just wondering how long do I need to 'rest' the area? (No stepper, no squats, no running...)  I have not run for about 20 years prior to, not since high school track.  And the real gripe of it is, I only ran for about a month, for a half mile or so everyday. This is quite painful but I would still like to try to stay in shape.","First of all, I am an avid runner myself and am not entirely sure of what this 'runner's knee' injury you're describing is.  In terms of treating the injury, if the pain in your knee is enough to physically stop you from running, or makes the motions difficult, you should stop running entirely for approximately 5 days before getting going again; during which time, you could look into getting an exercise ball or doing core workouts to maintain fitness.  

Icing your knee where the pain is most intense is always a good bet too: 15 minutes on, 15 minutes off is the widely-used standard.  In addition to icing, taking ibuprofen (Motrin/ Advil), will help decrease any inflammation, which is likely the cause of the pain.

Once you feel you can get out on your leg, you probably should, but should start out very slowly, but you shouldn't jump back into doing a half mile right away.  Your best bet is probably to start with an up-tempo walk, just to work on building up some stamina and to give your knee a good break.  After anywhere between 1 and 3 weeks of doing these walks (dependant on how soon the pain subsides), start substituting a few walks a week with light jogs; again, nothing too strenuous or long.

249232,Athsma or just out of shape?,"My fiance has asthma and recently we both began exercizing together. After a long hike at a strong pace, she began to complain that her asthma was bothering her. I also have asthma, but it is not excercize induced. So I am wondering if she is really experiencing asthma symptoms or just out-of-breatheness that comes with starting an exercize regimen. 

I myself have had breathing problems after a strenuous workout, but overcame them by getting in shape, so it's difficult for me to gauge whether or not what she is experiencing is asthma.","Features that suggest shortness of breath is due to asthma would include a wheeze when breathing out and a cough that produces mucus.  Since asthma is, by definition, reversible airways obstruction, her symptoms should improve when she takes her blue inhaler (assuming her 'reliever' inhaler is blue).  Next time she exercises she should take her blue 'ventolin/salbutamol' inhaler 20 minutes before exercise to see if that prevents her symptoms from occuring.  Exercise induced asthma is often worse in cold weather, when the person has a cold and at other times, such as when the pollen count is high.

Like eczema and hayfever, many people with purely exercise induced asthma grow out of it.

Maybe she needs to go to her doctor for a review of her asthma status and medication.",Athsma,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,I am wondering if she is really experiencing asthma symptoms,,,,,Not applicable

3848716,"What are the ""symptoms"" of ADD or ADHD?","I had parent/teacher conferences last night and my son's teacher brought up the fact the she believes he may have ADHD. She has been teaching for twenty-four years, so I believe she may have some experience with the illness (yes, I believe it IS an illness). She reccomended that I take him to our family doctor and I have already made the appoinment, but he can't be seen until early Dec. He is 7 yrs old and a very bright child, but has problems focusing, is very rambuctious, has problems following directions (if told to do two things he can do one, but gets distracted before doing number two, etc.), he talks excesivly sometimes just blurts things out rather then waiting for the appropriate time, among other things. I don't believe it to be a disipline issue, we have tried everything (his father and I) from time outs, taking privlages, and even spankings on the rare occasion. I was just wondering what the symptoms are and what sort of test do they run to diagnose something like this.","It certainly sounds like ADD, possibly ADHD. My son is 11 and he was diagnosed two years ago. We took him to a child psychologist who ran a whole series of tests on him, including IQ testing. What came from that was that he was very intelligent (scored very high on the IQ testing) but that he had ADHD. Your options for treatment are pretty limited, unfortunately. Medications are out there; I think I've read about behavioral therapy too, where a therapist works with the child (or adult - adults can have ADD, too) and helps them with organizational skills and that sort of thing. My husband and I tried just about everything you can think of to help our son before we had him tested - vitamins, supplements, dietary changes, grounding, yelling, taking away priveleges, all of it. When it came down to it, we finally agreed to try a low dose of Concerta and it has made all of the difference in the world. He's been taking it for about a year and a half now, and even he's happy with the difference. He isn't drugged out and dopey - he's himself, just a little more focused.

4228433,i suppose i have HSV-2.........?,"A week ago i had sex with my boyfriend , we didn't use condom, he ejaculated his sperm into me, i didn't had sores at that time but i have HSV-2, my bf still hasn't complain of any infection and also doesn't seem hiding anything.he looks fresh all the time.
My question is that whether he will be infected by HSV-2 in near or later future?
pls guide me out........and thanks for replying my earlier questions","Did the guy you got it from tell you????

If you keep having unprotected sex, he WILL get infected eventually, so YES, it could be both the near or later future! 

Sometimes people are infected and are ""asymptomatic"", meaning they do not show visible symptoms (blisters, and so on). They just complain of swollen glands or feeling sick, like they have the flu. They may not develop visible symptoms until their immune systems are very weak, and then it becomes apparent as sores show up. 

You need to tell him. Better you tell him now, while you are not having an outbreak, than at another time later, when you are. Imagine how you would feel if it was the other way around, if he was infected and you were not? Again, ya gotta wonder: did the guy you got it from tell you? 

Is he a new boyfriend? Was this the 1st time you two have had sex? You need to tell him! Your relationship should be built on trust and honesty, not sex. Tell him you were afraid to tell him then, but you know you have to now-and tell him right away! He'll appreciate your being truthful, albeit after the fact. At least then you two can talk about it when you have another outbreak in the future-and you WILL have more outbreaks. As you know, herpes is for life-no cure. It is unfair to keep it secret and possibly infect another person with herpes (for life!). 

If you are afraid he will break up with you if you tell him, well, he might. That's the chance you have to take. It's only fair: by having unprotected sex with him, you have already put him at the risk of contracting your incurable infectious STD. If he breaks it off with you after you tell him, it won't be because you have herpes (that may be the excuse though). It will be for one of two reasons: 1) he cannot trust you, 2) the relationship was mostly physical, and if that's the case, he wasn't going to stick around forever anyway.
 
If he does stick it out with you,  then you have a good man who cares about you. Then he's a ""keeper""-and you better treat him fairly and honestly from now on! 

You should do more research on HSV-2, since you now have it for the rest of your life. There is plenty of information available! Just search for ""herpes""-you'll see. DO be informed, don't be foolish or selfish.

HSV-2 is highly contagious! Just like chickenpox (which it is a very similar virus to), it's most contagious in the beginning stages of the outbreak,when there are only the 1st symptoms of tingling, itching and the first few small bumps. By the time you have visible sores, the damage is already done. Also,  in females, there can be blisters inside (the vaginal walls) that do not appear on the outside, so you cannot be sure. That is why you cannot have unprotected sex (oral is a RISK for him too!) 

ALSO: If you do not know a man well enough to know if your relationship will survive telling him you are infected, then you are having sex with him too soon. Wait to have sex until you two really get to know each other and are in a committed relationship with each other. That should come 1st. Otherwise, sex too soon usually just means more sex, that is, until one of you dumps the other one-and it will happen eventually-because there is no committment to each other.

Since you have herpes, you need to be more responsible for your own health as well as to not spread the virus around to someone else who can then go spreading it around to others. Clearly the person who infected you was not a virgin, or committed to your relationship, hence he was infected, infected you, and moved on to infect others, leaving you to also infect others, who, once infected, will also infect others.. Scary, isn't it? 

What's even scarier? This is exactly how HIV/AIDS is also continuing to spread, in the straight as well as gay population.

2193522,HPV vaccine for males?,Recently I heard about a vaccine for many strains of the HPV virus being given to women. I'm wondering about whether this vaccine is available for males as well. Surely cervical cancer caused by HPV is a problem for women but HPV can also cause cancer of the genitals and anus in men as well. Shouldn't this vaccine be given to everyone instead of being just available for women? Is this vaccine experimental or is it proven to be safe and effective? Thank you.,"I agree, the vaccine should be given to males. Males transmit it  too and do on occasion have problems from it. However, at this time it is only approved for females and suggested for girls between the ages of 9- 26 BEFORE they are sexually active. It  is considered effective for certain strains of HPV (16 and 18 are two) for up to 5 years. I guess time will tell if the shots hold up any longer than that.

Clinical trials for Gardasil was performed on girls between the ages of 16-23, therefore they have not tested it in men. The FDA will not approve it for men until it has been tested on them. I believe in time they will work on a vaccine for men, but right now the concern is with high risk strains of the virus that are linked to cervical and genital cancers in women, HPV effects men totally different. There is an extremely rare chance or penile cancer, and anal cancer in men who have anal sex, but overall HPV causes far less problems in men at this time. 
 
I have also heard that the next big thing in HPV is a vaccine of sorts for women that already have the virus, this would be awesome! Maybe men will be considered in the near future too.

Excessive straining, rubbing or cleaning the anus may worsen symptoms.

Hemorrhoids are caused by too much pressure in the rectum, forcing blood to stretch and bulge the walls of the veins. Sometimes the pressure ruptures the veins.

Medical treatment of hemorrhoids initially is aimed at relieving symptoms. Symptoms can be reduced by: sitting in a a warm tub, Ice packs (to help reduce swelling), usage of a hemorrhoidal cream. Increasing fiber and fluids in the diet will also help (makes softer stool).

In some cases, hemorrhoids must be treated surgically. The doctor will shrink and destroy the hemorrhoidal tissue.

You cannot """"catch"""" periodontal disease (gum disease) from anyone or someone's toothbrush.  It is NOT contagious.  It is caused by the growth of bacteria on the teeth and gums. Bacteria are present in plaque, a clear, sticky substance your mouth produces. If plaque is not removed promptly, it builds up on the teeth.

Prevention is simple:
Brush your teeth in the morning, after meals and snacks, and before bed using fluoride toothpaste. 
Try an electric toothbrush that has a rotating and oscillating (back-and-forth) action. This type of toothbrush is better at removing plaque.
Use an antiseptic mouthwash, such as Listerine, or a fluoride or antiplaque mouthwash. 
Floss once a day.  
Use disclosing tablets periodically so you can see if you are brushing effectively. 
See your dentist regularly to have your teeth cleaned and checked.

1716638,Is Gluten related to acne and depression (or other mental disorders)?,"After living in Korea for a few years, I returned to Canada. Within a few months bad acne started to appear on my back, and my energy levels became sluggish. 
In Korea, I ate a typical Korean diet consisting of rice, tons of veggies, sushi, no cooked meat, and very rarely ate bread. 
Upon returning to Canada, I was excited to eat sandwiches, and subs. So my diet is basically the same now, except the bread.
I know there is a connection. What other effects can Gluten have on people's general overall health?","Diet is o_ne of the most controversial areas of discussion when it comes to the topic of health in the modern age. Biological studies suggest that there is a direct link between acne and diet. In fact, some researchers say a poor diet is responsible for up to 90% of all acne-related cases. Unfortunately, when it comes to diet everyone's dietary needs and tolerances to different foods are different.

You should make sure that you avoid any foods you are allergic to. Testing is available at allergy specialists' offices to find out which foods you are either intolerant or allergic to. If this is not an option the best way to see if a particular food is causing or aggrevating your acne is to go o_n an elimination diet. By o_nly following a detox diet, you can't really see which foods your skin tolerates or not because the diet is so restrictive. I think a better way and easier way in the long term is to pick o_ne possible acne-causing food group and eliminate it from your diet for a couple of months to see if there is any improvement. For example, you can start with dairy foods...you continue to eat your normal diet but you eliminate all dairy for two months. If it works, great, if not then you can reintroduce dairy and pick another food group like high glycemic/refined carbohydrates...you do the same thing and see if it helps. As a normal rule the basic potentially acne-causing foods to test out are: dairy, carbs, high fat/fried foods, copper-rich foods and iodine-rich foods. By eliminating o_ne at a time, it will be much easier to follow than eating o_nly fruits nuts and veggies.

These following diets have been popular, and have proved successful in clearing acne for many acne sufferers.

Diet 1 - Dairy Free: No dairy, that means no cowï¿½s milk or any of the foods that are derived from cowï¿½s milk such as: cheese, yogurt, lactose, or dairy whey ext. Dairy foods contain many different drugs and hormones that come from the cowï¿½s body. Cows are fed grain with antibiotics added to the grain to prevent the cows from getting cow diseases such as mastitis. Mastitis is an inflammation of the cows udders. Antibiotics fed to cows pass into the milk, and milk products that we consume. These added antibiotics to our diets through consumption of dairy foods can cause some of us other physical problems as well as aggravate acne. Some researchers believe that feeding so many antibiotics to food animals can make diseases that people get become antibiotic resistant. Cows are fed hormones to increase their milk production. Women are especially affected by ingesting milk products from animals that have been fed hormones as supplements. Many people are also intolerant to the lactose in dairy. Lactose is milk sugar. This intolerance can induce diarrhea in some individuals.

Diet 2 - Gluten Free: Eliminate all gluten containing food products, which include Wheat, Barley, Rye and others. Around 30% of people have been shown to be intolerant to gluten to some degree. This intolerance creates digestive problems which creates inflammation in the gut. The inflammation that is created is a cause of acne in persons who have this particular digestive problem. Many chronic diseases are initially caused by various food intolerances such as the gluten intolerance so by eliminating this problem you eliminate a cause of acne, and you also eliminate a cause of possible future disease.

Diet 3 - Lectin Free: Lectins are sugar-binding proteins that mimic insulin. They bind to carbohydrates, and to various proteins. This binding action causes your body to attack itself, which in turn creates inflammation. This inflammation leads to more acne, among many other physiological problems. The Lectin-Free diet restricts things like grains, nightshades (ie. peppers, tomatoes, potatoes), legumes (ie. beans) and some starches.

I want to be precautious about this, so here's my questions:

1)  How contagious is the virus after the sore heals up?

2)  Could my husband already have contracted it from me sexually, even when I had no open sore?

*HSV-1 is not hereditary

*You can only spread it by kissing, or drinking from the same glass if you have an open sore.

*Once the sore is dried up and clear, you are no longer contagious. 

*Your children will only get it if you kiss them or drink after them from the same glass, when you have an open sore.

*You are not contagious to people on the street.

3464143,Itchy skin & eyelid?,"I have a strange burning rash on my things. Sometimes it itches, but most of the time it doesn't. It just burns. And it's not like I am wearing tight pants or clothing. 

Here's the thing...it stings only when the weather starts to get cold. It doesn't happen when the weather is warm/hot. The colder it gets, the more it burns and turns red/scaly.

I also have a strange itching on my eyelid. The same spot. All the time. Tried rinsing my eye with eyewash, but that is a temporary fix. I wear contact lenses & glasses interchangeably (not at the same time, of course).

2591948,11 weeks and Iron deficient?,"Ok, I am between 11 and 12 weeks pregnant, the doctors aren't 100% sure, and my due date is Oct. 15..  I just had a checkup and my doc says I am iron deficient.  I know what it means and all, but I would like to know some ways to get more iron in my diet without flat-out taking supplements.  If anyone has any recipes that are an easy way to get a decent amount of iron, I'd really appreciate them.  Or just reccomendations for foods to eat.  Thanks a bunch!","One simple way is to cook in cast iron pots.  If you cook acidic foods for a long time, you will get a *big* increase in the iron content of the food, in a form that your body can digest more easily than that in supplements.  I would suggest making some long-cooking tomato sauce.

In addition, liver is high in iron.  However, it is the organ that cleanses the blood of the animal, so it may be high in pollutants that aren't good for you at any time--especially when you're pregnant.  If you can get organic liver, I'd say go for it.

Other foods that have iron include green vegetables (broccoli and kale in particular; spinach and other green leafy vegetables also have iron, but in a very poorly-absorbed form), egg yolks, and whole grains (avoid all white flour and white rice).

Eating vitamin C foods together with your iron-rich foods also helps absorption.

There are some things I've learned from docs, some from painful experience, here they are; front to back motion is ok, it's the side to side that will get you.  Lifting is not good, but, remember, DDD is tricky and what you do today will probably not show up for 3 days, so you really have to pay attention to what you're doing and see how you feel 3 days from now (this is really hard to do).  DDD gets worse with time, so what you do this year that doesn't bother you may bother you next year.  The best way to keep your back in shape is; you have to exercise both your back AND your stomach muscles.  You need to have both the back and the front of your torso in good shape.

I went to the doctor today and I tested neg. for strep throat and mono. He said people with sinus infections get this but I have never had a sinus infection and then he didnt know what I had.

I was tired, my body was sore, and my throat was so sore that I could barely even swallow or talk.

It was positive. I really did not have any sniffles or anthing like that. I just laid on the couch and did nothing. The DR did give me an antibiotic for an infection that he <thought> I might have in my sinuses too. Now, I was told that it would take about 7-10 days for it to run its course. I have 2 small children, a job, and laundry! I do not have 7-10 days to spare!!!! So, I followed this regimen and immediately began to feel better. Took my antibiotic as prescribed. Every 2 hours, I gargled with warm salt water, drank a full glass of lukewarm water (didn't want to upset my stomach), and did a """"steam treatment"""" on my sinuses. Basically, I got a kitchen towel, soaked it in hot, steamy water, and without wringing it out, placed it over my mouth and nose and breathed in the warm steam. I also placed Vicks vapor rub over my chest and throat and slept with a warm heating pad over my chest while I got lots of rest!!!! I also added Mucinex which worked wonderfully.

what were the warning signs that you experienced when you were diognosed with diabetes? and how old were u? what is your life like now? 

i am just scared, i dont want to have this disease....","Hello,

First off I am not a Doctor. But I have had diabetes for over 34 years and have studied diabetes for years.

With your family history it is very possible that you too could have diabetes. The disease is heredity. There are several different types of diabetis and by what you explained in your question it sounds like you might have HYPOGLYCEMIA. This is caused by your pancreous producing too much of the hormone INSULIN. What this means is that your body is producing too much insulin and causes your sugar level to drop. This causes the symptoms you explained. In fact, I have the very same symptoms when my blood sugar is low. Without a decent sugar level (70-120) your body does not have the energy you need to move. This is usually controlled by diet, exercise, and testing your blood sugar. A glucose test will tell the Dr. if your body is producing enough insulin to handle large amounts of sugar. If your body is not handling the sugar will your results will show high blood sugar. The thyroid can also play a part in diagnosing diabetis.

Symptoms of uncontrolled diabetis include headaches, extreme tiredness, vomiting, stomach pain, excessive urination and burning when you urinate, sores that won't heal, and extreme thirst and without treatment could lead to you passing out and coma.

I was about 11 when I was diagnosed and I'm 45 now. I have lived a good life and not much stands in my way. I pretty determined. I have my ups and downs and I do have a few complications like neuropthy. I've had two children and both of them are fine. The only difference is I have to pay attention to my disease, test my sugar, eat right. Nothing more than what an extreme health nut would do to stay healthy.

Good luck and let me know if you have any questions.

1042442,"Adoption of sibling, OMG tantrums, Please help?","We are in process of transitioning 3 year old sibling to our previously adopted twins who are almost 5. This poor litlle guy has had major trauma with being removed from his home and placement. The biggest concern we have is when he gets really mad he will throw his head against objects or the floor. One time he picked up a little childrens chair and threw it and screamed. I told him I would not listen to him do that and when he was done to please pick up the chair and put it back. I walked away and a couple of minutes later when he was quiet, I saw that he HAD in fact put the chair back and said sorry. I asked if he was feeling better, he said yes and we hugged it out and I told him that the behaviour is not aceptable and I don't want him to keep hurting himself. He has major speech and language delays. Any advice on how to help a child that hurts himself? We predict this scenerio when leaving a fun activity/place as well. Any coping techniques? Not hitting, please. Transition help?","Wow! This poor little guy has gone through a lot of changes! What a good person you are for doing your best to support him! Temper tantrums are caused by children who are not getting their needs met. If they are not throwing a tantrum because they are sick, hungry, or tired, they will throw a tantrum because it feels powerful, they get attention for it, they are testing limits, or they are simply feeling frustrated. I think youy son is just feeling pretty powerless right now.

Avoid punishing or threatening. When he throws a tantrum, do the unexpected. Either walk away or move him to a quiet place (his room, the couch) and say ï¿½When you are ready to calm down then you can come back.ï¿½ Say nothing more than that. This can be his place to vent. This is not a time out because you are not setting a time limit (you controlling him). He returns when he is ready to control himself. You may have to return him to the designated spot before he gets the message. I like how you asked him if he was feeling better. I think itï¿½s the perfect thing to say once he is calm.

Empathize with him when he has calmed down. ï¿½I can tell you were feeling very (mad, angry, upset, hurt, sad, frustrated). What can we do about that?ï¿½ or ï¿½I can tell you miss the other home you were staying at. It makes you feel sad that youï¿½re not there anymore.ï¿½ Do some problem solving and give him words to use. He will then learn to better express himself.

When he is hurting himself, express your feelings. """"I'm worried you might get hurt. It upsets me when you do that."""" Give him something to take his anger out on. You could give him a special pillow or find one of those punching clowns (just a throught). It may help redirect his anger from himself to another object.

Help him to feel powerful by saying thing like ï¿½Look how fast you can run! You did that by yourself! You stacked every block! You used so many colors on you picture!ï¿½ These are intrinsic motivators rather than extrinsic rewards (""""Good job,"""" stickers, candy).These phrases are great ways to help your son feel powerful, gain confidence, and show attention in a positive way.",tantrums,,,,,,we hugged it out,we hugged it out,The biggest concern we have is when he gets really mad he will throw his head against objects or the floor.,tantrums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Any advice on how to help a child that hurts himself?

3451403,I have knee pain and am not sure if I have a minor MCL tear or a medial meniscus tear- How can I tell?,"This started exactly 3 weeks ago. I have NO swelling, full range of motion, no discoloration, no prior history of knee problems- ever. There was no """"sudden injury"""" - exercise a lot and it started hurting after a long day of working out. The pain is mainly on the inner side of my left knee. I also feel a soreness over my kneecap, but I'm not sure if that's just secondary pain. I'm not taking anti-inflammatories because I'm afraid that they will interfere with the healing process. The pain isn't killing me, but it bothers me and I'm afraid that this isn't going to get better.  I can walk without a limp, but honestly I do feel tenderness and a little pain when I do walk. I have icing the injury 3 times a day and am not sure if I should continue icing my knee since there has never been any visible swelling.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!","It sounds to me as though it is a MCL strain.  If your knee starts to click, give way or lock, there is more of a problem.  Avoid twisting on the knee and going upstairs with it first.

I would start using heat on the area.  This will increase the circulation and the healing to the area.  If at any time you start to feel increased pain with the heat, stop and return to the ice.

Knees are strange creatures.  Even one teaspoon of extra fluid/swelling within the knee joint can stop the thigh muscles working for 3-5 days.  It is virtually impossible to tell if this small amount of swelling is even present - not even an MRI would detect it!

Try using a simple knee brace when you are up and about, even an ACE wrap would help.  This will just give you an extra bit of support, but do not rely upon braces - they can actually make you weaker in the long term.

If things do not calm down in the next 5-7 days, ask your doctor for a referal to a good physical therapist.

The allergen is either something she is exposed to externally or something she is getting from your breastmilk or from the infant formula your using. try changing formulas if your using them. If breastmilk, then you must start the process of elimination and see what makes a difference when you exclude it from your diet. A good indicator can be some thing you eat that unsettles her after feeding time. Possibly find out from a Naturopath what foods you are sensitive to and eliminate those from your diet also as they can pass through as well. Try changing the covers and clothes you use to natural fabrics as well.
Antihistamines are not great for infants and are a last resort. Try some Calendular Ointment, this will sooth the rash as will bathing with Chamomile Tea. See this website http://www.carolineskincare.com.au this is a wonderful natural product that can help as well, I have used it a lot in my clinic and on my own kids. These are only topical (external)treatments, the underlying allergen (cause) needs to be found and gotten rid of so please do not think that it has cleared when the rash dies down a bit.
It is also possible she has Psoriasis which is also aggravated by allergies and heat.

You cannot cut down a tree by cutting off its branches, you have to go for its trunk and its root. Sometimes we only cut branches, sometimes we cut off the trunk, but if you don't take out the roots, the tree always grows back.

The obvious suggestion is to go see a therapist. However, that alone will not do it. It is important to seek outside support, bulimia groups and family support are important. If family is not an option, seek friends. The more shame you have, the more you will hide it and feed into the disease. It is important to accept it and find others who will accept you for it, so that eventually with their support and your own persistence you can overcome it.",bulimia,,,NA,I have been fighting this for about 15 years now.,bulimia,,,,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,I need someone who knows what I'm going through.,,,Any of you living like this?

I am just a microbiology technician, in Australia.

I would say: """"Be reassured (a bit) by the way the Dr did not worry much about the goo that came out, when he hit the right spot.""""

I suppose the Dr burst an abscess.  These are full of pus; blood and white blood cells.  They often stink badly, due to containing anaerobic bacteria, and their waste products.

Many places in and on our bodies are normally inhabited by anaerobic bacteria, and they can be fine, if they stay in the right place.  If they get into bad places, they can lead to abscesses forming, but these burst, and then all is OK ... eventually.

Occasionally, we need help from antibiotics, to get rid of these bacteria from places they should not live in.

3898916,Anyone ever had gum grafting??,"I am going to the peridontist on Thurs. to look into having several soft tissue grafts on my lower front teeth.  I had gum loss (severe) after my braces came off and my dentist is worried I may suffer bone loss if we don't get the graft soon.  I have good insurance, but I wondered how much something like that was per tooth.  Any one had this done before & know the ball park figure per tooth??  And how was the post op??  Painful for very long?  How was the spot where they removed the graft from, did it hurt much???  What did the finished product look like - did it look good, natural??  Thanks!","My son is having it done this Friday for his lower front teeth (both, I believe.)  He also needs a Frenulectomy (where they snip that little piece of skin tht connects your lower lip to your bottom gums) because his is too short & is what caused his gums to recede.  The total cost for both is around $970.  (I'm expecting the insurance to cover about 80% of that.) They say the graft site on the roof of your mouth feels like it might feel after getting burned from eating really hot pizza.  But since my son is only 8, we're going with the alloderm grafts instead, because it will be less invasive & less painful for him.   The peridontist said the whole thing should take about 1/2 hr to 45 minutes.  Supposedly the mouth heals very quickly, so I'm sure he'll be good to go by Monday.  We were told he will need to eat cold & soft foods for the next day or so & gradually return to a normal diet.    As far as what it will look like, I don't even think we'll ever see it unless we look for it, since it's the bottom 2 teeth, which are almost always hidden by his lip, anyway.

There might be complications/ severe pain after surgery. Is it natural to suffer from severe throat infections (itching, pain, ear-ache) due to a tonsils problem? I am also not able to work in an air-conditioned office due to my tonsils problem. My ears start aching and I have trouble breathing. Will these problems go away after surgery? My doctor seems to think so but I have doubts. Anybody been through such a problem? Please help!! Thanks","1. You will feel tired following the procedure because of the anesthetic and pain medication you have been given.

2. You will have some soreness of the throat. The pain may get worse before it gets better. It is important to take your pain medication as prescribed by your surgeon. With the sore throat you may not feel like taking anything by mouth. Even so, you must drink fluids. A cool mist humidifier can be soothing for your throat.

3. You may experience pain in your ears. This is common during the first week.

4. You will have bad breath from scabs where the tonsils were removed. These scabs fall off in about 7 to 10 days, and your breath odor will return to normal. Do not gargle, as this will hurt and may cause bleeding. Rinse your mouth with any antiseptic mouthwash.

5. Diet: eating may not be possible right away. The first day you should favour: clear fluids such as water, apple juice, Gatorade, and popsicles. Avoid: citrus juices and carbonated beverages (colas) because they may cause increased pain and throat irritation. After a few days start trying foods that are easy to swallow. Favour: Jello, soft noodles, warm broth, puddings, yogurt, and ice cream. Avoid: steamy, hot, or spicy foods or hard, crunchy foods.

6. Avoid constipation, be sure you include plenty of liquids in your diet. You may require a mild laxative.

7. You may return to work in about 1-2 weeks. Most adults need about 1 week to recuperate and return to a more normal diet.


What should I avoid following my tonsillectomy?

1. You are not to drive a motor vehicle for 24-48 hours. Follow your physician's instruction regarding any alternate or additional restrictions.

2. You must have a responsible adult accompany you home and stay with you over night.

3. No beer or alcohol for 24 hours.

4. Do not sign legal documents or make important decisions for 24 hours.

5. Do not operate machinery or perform tasks requiring skill, coordination, or judgement within 24 hours after your procedure.

6. Do no participate in any physical fitness or contact sports for 10 days to 2 weeks.

When should I call the doctor?

1. If you have bleeding other than blood tinged saliva, bleeding more than 2 tablespoons of blood or you vomit blood, please inform your surgeon at once. If you cannot reach your surgeon, go to the Emergency Department of the nearest hospital.

2. You may have a slight fever (38ï¿½C or 100ï¿½F) for a couple of days. If fever persists for more than 48 hours and or you develop chills, contact your doctor.

I went through the same thing, fatigue, temperature, aching, and dizziness. I had my employer prescribe an antibiotic then had a root canal (RCT). The antibiotic is a temporary solution, it will not take care of this problem permanently. If it is a wisdom tooth, you simply need an extraction. But only a dentist can make a proper diagnosis. It is possible to die from an infection like this, but those are extreme cases. The only way to take care of your problem is to see a Dentist, have a radiograph, and exam. They will make an appropriate treatment plan. Check your area, see if they have medicaid offices, free dental clinics in place, or clinics that have a sliding scale fee.

During this time I met quite a few patients with prostate cancer, some of them had been patients for years.

Some of the patients also had bone scans which showed secondary involvement. The treatments used ranged from radical prostatectomy to hormone treatment (this was used on research patients) and in most instances these treatments worked pretty well. However, I would hate to give you false hope, 374 is pretty high and the swollen lymph glands mean that there is a probability that the cancer has spread.

Like many emotional problems we tend to create them when they do not actually exist.  Telling people not to worry about this or that is no help at all.  Friends should take the time to listen.  After understanding what is causing the stress then go through it with them and point out The factors that can be solved and those that cant usually have no real basis.  One of the best help for such people is to get them to talk about it.  When people hear themselves talk they most of the time can see things more clearly.  When you listen to others things don't seem so bad.  The same is true when you listen to yourself talking to some other person.  If there is no one there to talk to then talk to yourself out loud to hear your own words.

Congratulations on sticking with the AA program. You are doing a great job and I hope you stick with it. You have made another positive step forward by putting yourself out on Answers.

I am not an alcoholic, but several of my friends are and I have done everything possible to support them, so, I hope that I have some advice/insight that benefits you.

First and foremost, ask your fellow AA members, as well as AA management, about any doctors they would specifically recommend who are sensitive to the needs of recovering alcoholics/addicts.

You are right: recovering alcoholics face some specific health concerns best dealt with by a doctor who understands.

Diabetes, liver disease, digestive problems, cardiac, hepatitis, ocular disease, and immune system problems are all side effects of alcoholism.

This website below is a special AA website for doctors who are also recovering alcoholics:
http://www.idaa.org/
Contact them. They will be able to provide you with doctors sensitive to your needs.

The original AA founder's home:
http://www.drbobshome.org/index.html
Send them an email explaining your situation. They will find a way to provide information to you.

I would start off with these two sites and build from there. With time spent researching your concerns, you will discover a lot more information.

Keep on doing what you are doing: asking questions, being strong, reminding yourself what is really important, and your willingness to want to help others is very inspiring.

I think you will be very successful with continuing to control your alcoholism and your desire to help others is the most powerful medicine of all for you.

This was a huge relief.  I don't know if it was the decreased stress or what, but that night my period started.  At first I thought that this was from the sono because it was vaginal, but I went to work the next day and asked.  It was finally my period!

401725,"Low progesterone level and consecutive miscarriages,trying to conceive again?","Hi, We have been trying for a baby for 2 years.
I was conceived for 3 times and had early miscarriages.
 I dont have inferitility problem,bec., i already have one son and also had miscarriages.
My gyno said my progesterone level is low, and told me to start the medication once i conceive.But its been 4 months after i had my last miscarriage.Its really awfull, but i consoled myself, bec., i dont want the stress to stop me getting pregnant.
Can anybody suggest any way to get me pregnant? Or to increase the progesterone level?","This progesterone level in itself is only a little bit below the optimum for a peak progesterone level. I wonder if there isn't some other reason suggesting low progesterone (or luteal phase insufficiency) such as a short cycle or premenstrual spotting that is pushing your physician in the direction of prescribing Clomid. Without knowing more about your situation, it is hard to know if this is the best intervention for you at this time.

Have you been identifying the peak mucus day for several months, and having intercourse on that day for at least six months? What is the quality of your cervical mucus? Did you have an infection since the birth of your last child that might have caused a tubal blockage or uterine inflammation? Have your thyroid levels been checked? Have you had an ultrasound that might show a polyp or fibroids? Has your husband had a semenalysis? 

With two prior pregnancies, it might be a little soon do a laparoscopy to check for endometriosis or other problems but if infertility persists that might be in order.

Clomid is a legitimate therapy in the medical literature for luteal phase insufficiency as well as lack of ovulation. But it can also cause poor mucus and a thin endometrial lining in some people. A more thorough workup of the luteal phase (the time in the cycle after ovulation) might be helpful in determining the best therapy. At Pope Paul VI Institute, the type of workup for this problem might include THREE determinations of progesterone AND estrogen five, seven and nine days after ovulation (as determined by ovulation predictor kits or peak day in charting). Estrogen levels should be in the range of 110 or 120(or 11 or12 depending on the lab). Progesterone should be at least 12 on peak plus five days, 15 on peak plus 7, and 12 on peak plus nine.

Sometimes progesterone will drop off rapidly nine days after ovulation even though values to that point are optimal. We diagnose a late luteal phase insufficency if the progesterone nine days after the peak drops 50% below the value seven days after the peak. If only one progesterone determination is made,you will not be able to diagnose a luteal phase insufficiency. If you have good mucus and estrogen, there are no other problems, and only progesterone is deficient, my feeling is progesterone vaginal capsules in a 600 mg. dose may be a better therapy. These are available by prescription from Kubat pharmacy in Omaha, Nebraska.

If both estrogen and progesterone are deficient AND you are ovulating, the method most often used at Pope Paul VI is very low dose Clomid (25 mg. day three, four and five of the cycle) followed by HCG injections (2000 units every other day for four doses starting three days after the peak). This is a more complicated therapy, but the low dose of Clomid given earlier in the cycle has less adverse effect on the mucus than standard regimens and is very effective if you are already ovulating and have luteal phase insufficiency of both progesterone and estrogen.",miscarriages,,Female,NA,"Its really awfull, but i consoled myself, bec., i dont want the stress to stop me getting pregnant.",miscarriages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Can anybody suggest any way to get me pregnant?,Can anybody suggest any way to get me pregnant?,,,Can anybody suggest any way to get me pregnant?,Yes: (All examples shared in the response)

Then to top it off I am now having siezers. And my hands shake even when I don't have a migraine. I had an EEG but there was nothing. I have been under stess.(trying to buy a new house, fight with the inlaws, and kids) I really thought I was ok with all of this. I started depakote on may 2nd. and yet still all this is happening I am now up to 500mg twice a day. Can anyone think of anything that might help. I'm tired of the feeling that people think it's all in my head. PLEASE HELP","I'm a nurse practioner who treats only women so I see TONS of women suffering with stess reactions and migranes. If you are having true siezures where you pass out and have the classic jerking movements,you should have an MRI of your brain to be certain that there isn't anything such as a tumor causing these new symptoms. An MRI is a special imaging test that can actually see these lobes of the brain,blood vessels and bony structures,kind of like an Xray but able to see things the Xray can't. Your shaking hands sound more like anxiety and or panic. A panic attack can feel like you're having a heart attack and a few people will actually pass out or have odd movements that can be misdiagnosed as a siezure. The migranes can often be controlled or at least made more manageable with daily medication. I'd suggest you talk to your health care provider and ask to be put on something like Lexipro or Paxil. These are both antidepressants but are also excellent for dealing with stress and anxiety and can also decrease the frequency and severity of the headaches.If you notice that your headaches are the worst on your period or about halfway between them and you're not on birth control pill somtiimes taking the pill to even out the hormone  levels can be helpful.I often use a drug called Verapamil taken daily to try and prevent you from having as many headaches.It's a blood pressure med but acts to prevent some of the changes in the brain that cause the migrane pain. I'm a migrane sufferer too and last year mine got ugly but since I started Verapamil in August I haven't had one at all . I've had the aura several times but the pain never came. I was surprised that it worked this well.Usually, it makes things more managable at least.There are other thing that can help such as feverfew supplement, magnesium or a B vitamin called riboflavin. These need to be taken daily and take a while to become effective. Don't give up till you get some relief. Your best bet is to find someone who specializes in women's issues or a headache specialist if none of the usual things work. I know this is a long answer but it's a complicated problem. There!

Hi, I was diagnosed with lupus almost 2 years ago after over 11 years of dealing with various symptoms and flares and kidney disease.

I saw online that there is something called CellCept that may work to reduce lupus symptoms that may have more tolerable symptoms than chemo, but I don't want to jump into anything.

2128319,"Do you think that it is unfair that I have to Babysit my 15-year old brother who has autism, ADHD and........?",Asperger's syndrome. Yes he has temper tantrums and i am in junior high and he is a sophomore in H.S. and when my mom and Dad are working i have to watch him...But here is the catch i am downstairs watching tv and we have a PS2 and he lives on the PS2 and the computer but when he dies on either one he throws a fit and starts pounding on the futon that is detroyed and pictures of my dads medals (he was in the army) start falling off and he does not care all he cares about is the playstation... Can You give me some advice please that would be greatly appreciated!!,"It sounds unfair. But being part of a family is about coming together as unit and working towards all of your happiness and prosperity. If you parents have to work and can't be provided with a care worker to watch you brother then I guess they have no choice.
I must be very difficult to have a brother with these syndromes and I have alot of respect for you for looking after your brother...its not a task any of your family asked for and I'm sure you love him very much.
Its sounds like you should  sit down and talk calmly to your parents about this when they are not busy themselves(ie not stressed). You need to be objective and explain that it is too much for you as a 15year to be looking after your brother all this time, you have your own life too. Would it be possible to get a care worker that could come and watch your brother when they work. Or could you come to a compromise where you look after him less and someone else watches him(care worker/sibling/family member) at other times.
I'm from the UK, so US may be different but in the UK your family would be entitled to a full-time care worker for free. Maybe your family are entitled to something similar.
ISSuE;HE BECOMES VIOLENT TO YOUR FURNISHINGS WHEN HE DIES ON PLAYSTATION
With this you need to make your parents clear on what he does and how it makes you feel(does it distress you?). Further I think that you a should keep in mind the Police have a duty to come round if you feel unsafe or he is going to far. Nothing bad will happen to your brother they will just calm him down and restrain him(reasonably). He won't go to jail as they will understand his symptoms. Its important to know that the Police are there to help citizens not just catch criminals.","autism, ADHD and Asperger's syndrome",,,NA,,,,,,,starts pounding on the futon that is destroyed and pictures of my dads medals (he was in the army) start falling off and he does not care all he cares about is the playstation.,starts pounding on the futon that is destroyed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Can You give me some advice please that would be greatly appreciated!!,Yes: It sounds unfair.

508297,hello' I have something like ten gallbladder tuny stones. they are 2 or 3 mm long. do you have hints?,"I am taking ursobil in pills which is an acid supposed to clean the gallbladder and dissolve the small stones if they are composed of cholesterol. If not I don't know. One doctor told me it shoudl be operated as they could move and go in some duct while others told me not too. the glabladder is not full at all, there are just few, day 10 little stones. Do you have experience about it? suggestion?thanks","The most common disorder of the biliary tract (gallbladder and bile ducts) is gallstones. Why and how gallstones form is not fully understood, but it is thought that in some cases an abnormality in function causes the gallbladder to remove an excessive amount of water from the bile so that some of its constituents can no longer remain in solution. Gallstones occur very frequently in developed countries and may be associated with eating a diet that is high in fat and refined carbohydrates and low in fiber. As many as 10-20 percent of the U.S. population over the age of forty have gallstones, but only in a minority do symptoms occur. If gallstones are found by chance on an X-ray taken for some other reason it is standard practice to leave them alone if they are causing no symptoms, since the risk of developing problems is slightly less than the risk from a major operation. However, if a patient with asymptomatic gallstones is having an abdominal operation for another reason, the gallbladder may be removed at the same time. The problems that gallstones can give rise to are various and include cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), choledocholithiasis (gallstones in the common bile duct), and cholangitis (infection of the bile ducts), pancreatitis, and gallstone ileus (obstruction of the intestines by a gallstone).
Make sure you eat a low fat diet, lose weight and exercise. This will help prevent the need for an operation. As a nurse personally I would try the diet with the tablets you have first THEN the operation if dieting didn't help.

I'm not sure if that would cause your other symptoms, though, but maybe when you get checked your doctor can fill you in.

I also think your """"sensitive bladder"""" could be interstitial cystitis -- that's a chronic irritation/inflammation of the lining of the bladder from an unknown cause, but not caused by a bacterial infection.  I have a couple of friends who have this, and it can become very painful if not treated, but there are treatments that can make the pain a lot better.  Also, I'm not sure, but if you turn out to have both conditions you might want to ask whether high blood sugar might be related to the symptoms of I/C, or make them worse...

I do not have OCD but my husband does and his has to do with such thoughts and horrible feelings of guilt. We are also devoted Christians and church members. He gets through most of it with a lot of support from his family and with professional therapy. This is not something that is going to just go away you have to work on it every day. First you have to know that when Jesus died on the cross he didn't say ok I forgive every one but you. You deserve it just as much as anyone else. Even He forgave those who put him on the cross. You need to pray and be thankful of this everyday. Speak to God as your constant companion in everything you do and you feel the difference. He is your Father and loves you as such. Second try to find a counselor you are comfortable with that you can express you thoughts and feelings to so you can stop the cycle of thoughts roaring in your head. It also helps if you can write them down, make sure you write all of them down. You don't ever have to read them again and you can destroy the pages if you like but you should still write down your thoughts. 

Finally and this is important, we learned after several years of bad doctors and wrong medications that a heart condition can cause and worsen this problem. Its called mitral valve prolapse and it messes up the autonomic system so that your chemistry is never normal. You should be check out for this as your heart can get worse with time and sometimes a beta blocker used for high blood pressure can help with your thoughts. Until you do get your heart checked out be sure to stay away from any mental health drugs because this condition also alters their effects.

1788336,So I had my son Aug 30th of last year.  I got an extreme case of post pardum depression.?,"Anti- depressants made it worse so I stopped taking them.  A year later I finally went back,  They diagnosed me with a chemical imbalance and panic attacks.  I am now on a mood stabalizer and xanax for my attacks.  I have been on treatment for 4 months, I feel alot better, but I dont feel my depression has gone away.  Also I am still overweight from my pregnancy and I think my pills are making me gain weight.  I am not embracing motherhood or family life at all.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can just be content with where I am at.  I have always wanted to be married and have children, but now that i have it, its like the last thing I want.  Please any suggestions would be helpful","Hon, this situation sounds very familiar.  Take solace in the fact that you're not alone.

I started having depression and panic attacks after my first was born, and they hung around for a good eight years.  I was on medication, on and off, and had to, like you, take Xanax for the panic attacks.  

Unfortunately, postpartum depression can affect your bonding with your baby, and can affect your relationship with your husband.  Some antidepressants are targeted to treat panic disorders more than they are depression.

If what you're taking isn't working for you, I would suggest that you talk to your health professional to try you on something that might.  For instance, Prozac made me panic more, whereas Zoloft did the trick for me.  Paxil worked, too, but it was making me gain a lot of weight.  Effexor XR made me so UNhorny, I didn't even want to have sex with myself, let alone anyone else.

In the battle of finding a good antidepressant, sometimes it takes multiple combinations before your doctor will find what's right for you.  Zoloft is what worked wonders for me, but Paxil may be the best for you.  What works on one person doesn't always work for another.

Do yourself and your family a favor, though.  If you're still depressed, go see your doctor.  The drug combination that you're taking is not working for you the way that it should.

On a side note, get your thyroid tested, too, as this can keep you from losing weight and can make you depressed and anxious if it is underactive (which is common after a woman gives birth).

Has anyone else ever had problems with birth control and anxiety or mood changes? Also, is spotting normal when you first start bcp's, because these are causing that, but the ortho never did, I had to stop taking ortho because it gave me pancreatitis. So...if I have PCOS, what other treatments could I do. I am tired of going to doctors, they aren't seeming to help me.

4319522,is it possible for oral pain medication to be stopped or destroyed before reaching the brain?,"My brother has been given pretty much everything for the pain in his legs, Neurontin 600mg, hydrocodone 10/325, ect and absolutely no pain relief, not even the slightest.  We did find out he has lymphedema, 2nd degree, also cellulitis, and he is being treated with the manual lymph drainage and wrappings, which seems to be helping with the leg swelling, but thus far, after 3 treatments still has not done anything for the pain.  Is it possible that the pain medications get to a certain point and are destroyed before reaching that part of the body where it sends signals to the brain that its not feeling pain....the signals to the brain that its feeling an 8 or more on the pain scale is not blocked at all, pain is a constant 24/7.,  pain pills do not block the signals.

It's good your brother is getting the care he needs.  Cellulitis is infection and can become serious, if he has active infection right now he should NOT be in therapy, when the infection has cleared it would be ok to treat again.  The swelling and heaviness of the fluid pressing on nerves can be very painful.  Alot of us with the condition have chronic and debilitating pain.  Has he been evaluated for fibromyalgia?  It tends to go hand in hand with lymphedema as does chronic fatigue, high blood pressure, thyroid issues, etc.  Restless leg and sleep apnea are other problems that we lymphers have too.  Pain patches probably won't help, you could try it but without the proper circulation and knowing exactly the cause of the pain, it might be a waste of money.

1115174,pregnancy with migraines?,I have horrible full blown migraines. Where I lay their and shake and can't talk. It is painful to rest my head on the pillow. If I move any part of my body it is horrible pain. I have injections I take for this. But now that i'm pregnant I cant take anything and my dr is a bitc* because If you haven't experienced this for your self it's not possible to know the pain. Does anyone know what I can do that will help me? Maybe something natural or whatever Just to make it go away. If you haven't experienced this please don't give me a stupid answer. My sister has told me that child birth is less painful than a full blown migraine. She gets them very seldom. I get them everyother day. Does or did anyone have the same problem?,"There's good news and there's bad.  The bad news is that having Migraines while pregnant IS horrible!  The good news is that a lot of pregnant woman find that their Migraines decrease or even disappear while pregnant.  This relief often carries through to breastfeeding and some women never experience a Migraine ever again.

You didn't say whether your doctor is your OB-Gyn or not.  Regardless, if you think your doctor is a bitc* and you don't like her, fire her!   You do not work for her.  She works for you and you pay her for her services.  You or your insurance company will be paying her a lot to deliver your child.  You deserve the best medical care for you and your unborn child and there's no reason why you have to continue seeing someone that you don't like or TRUST. 

If you don't have a doctor or a neurologist that treats your headaches, you should find one.  In case you don't know, there are doctors that limit their practice to headache treatment only.  They are called Headache Specialist.  You may be able to find one in the directory below.  This directory is """"...based on either first-hand recommendations by their patients or recommendations by other specialists with whom we have established relationships.""""

[**Remember, before starting anything new, you should always discuss it with you doctor first.]
To help you get through the Migraine attacks, you might want to check into a complementary therapy(ies).  These alternatives may not abort a Migraine but it may help to ease it.  Some of these therapies include, massage, Acupuncture, Biofeedback, relaxation and/or visualization therapy, ice and/or heat packs, and aromatherapy, 

Of course it's best to be medication-free while you're pregnant.  This does not mean that there are no medications that can be taken during your pregnancy.  Dr. Lawrence Robbins, one of the top 10 headache medication experts in the US, has some great information on his website.  This excerpt from his book Headache Help discusses options including some medications that may possibly be used during pregnancy.  
http://www.headachedrugs.com/archives/pregnancy.html
Printing this out and taking it with you to discuss with your doctor at your next visit may be a good idea.  Another idea is to ask your OB-Gyn to contact the doctor who treats your Migraines and maybe the 3 (Yes, I did say THREE) of you come up with a Migraine management plan TOGETHER.

Lastly, Migraine is not a just a bad headache.  It's not caused by too much stress (although stress can exacerbate it)  or other emotional issues.  It is a real genetic neurological disease that there is no cure for.   Migraines can be completely disabling and the pain can be the worst you've ever experienced in your entire life.  It's is very important to remember that Migraine pain lasting more than 72 hours with less than a solid 4 hours relief can be dangerous and should be considered an emergency requiring an doctor visit or or a trip to the emergency room.","pregnancy, migraines",,Female,NA,horrible pain,migraines,,,,,dr is a bitc*,If you haven't experienced this for your self it's not possible to know the pain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Does anyone know what I can do that will help me?

1072561,What is causing my back pain?,Hello... I have suffered from upper and lower back pain for 14 years due to a car wreck.  I deal with it everyday and I know what is causing it.  I am however having a completely different problem today and it started yesterday while I was deep cleaning my mom's house.  The stabbing pain is on the left side of my back ranging from my shoulder blade down to my kidney.  I also have the same pain in my right shoulder (from the top to my neck).  The pain is tingly and stabbing at the same time.  When I move the pain changes and I can get into a position where I don't feel it at all.  Does anyone with experience know if the problem I'm having has to do with nerves or simply pulled muscles?  I've had many sore muscles in my days but have never felt anything like this.  I'm mainly asking because I know I won't be able to get in to see my doctor until at least Monday and I need to know if I should take it easy or try to continue moving around.  I appreciate any advice I can get.  Thanks!,"It does seem like a nerve problem, probably compression of a nerve(s). Do not strain your back.

I had gotten a lot of info from the American Cancer Society.  Try this link: http://www.cancer.org/docroot/home/index.asp.  There is info there about trials and treatments.  On certain patients (not my dad) they can do chemo.  In Multiple Myeloma the symptoms can be treated, but there is no cure.  My dad received steroid treatment.  He had gotten radiation to a couple of really painful areas and it seemed to help him a lot.  Also he got blood transfusions when his blood count was off and that helped too.  He did end up going on dialysis because as the cancer eats the bone, calcium is released into the system and the kidneys can't handle too much calcium.  Sometimes patients receive stem cell transplants. Good luck to the patient & family.

1724967,Does my 3 year old have Tourettes?,"A couple of days ago (about 6) my son started """"double blinking"""" and it started after he hung out with his half uncle who has Tourettes. I don't know if he picked it up, if it is a nervous habit or if he really has Tourette. My husband is telling me not to worry about it because him and his brother don't have the same dad...and it is genetic. I have taken him to his pedatrician today and she pretty much refered me to a Neuroligist to check him out. If I let them give him an ECG (is that right?) will it definatley let me know if he has tourettes or is it pretty hard to discover? I think Im going to cancel the appt. and see what happens in a month or so. See if anyother tics have developed. Has anyone else ever dealt with this? What symptoms should I be watching for? Thanks for your help.","Tourettes is a Neurological disorder in the brain.  It is not contagious.  The conventional wisdom is that it is hereditary, but there has been recent genetic research that may suggest otherwise. (I have the info, please let me know if you'd like it).

Three is pretty early for symptoms to start, but not impossible.  My recommendation is keen observation, notes, and a video camera.  

An EEG is good, but not a determining factor in diagnosing Tourettes.  It will, however, rule out any seizure disorders, and that is important.  There is no """"one"""" test for Tourettes.  It is diagnosed by observation in the Dr. office and your oral history.
DO THIS:  While he is playing alone and there are minimal distractions, video tape him without him knowing.  This will prevent him from """"hamming it up"""" for the camera.  This information will help tremendously in the diagnostic process.  Your notes and observations will also be vital to the process.  We did this (video tape) with our son when the tics and vocal tremors were very obvious, just in case they were not present during the prescribed day and time of the appointment. 

Tourettes is difficult to diagnose in small children because it is difficult to know if the movements and/or sounds they are making are in their control.  And since he is so young, it would be difficult to ask him.  If you have referral a Pediatric Neurologist in your area, I would keep the appointment as an office/information visit.  Assuming the tics continue,  bring your video camera (to show that tape) and your husband with you.  For some reason, a Doctor will take a set of parents seriously and not attribute what you are saying to """"a hysterical mom"""".   Start a relationship with this doctor.  This will help over the years.  

ABOVE ALL stay calm.  Having a child with Tourettes is not the worst thing in the world.  You will find this to be true when you spend any amount of time in a Pediatric Neurology waiting room.  And please ignore the stupid, uninformed, and rude answers that will come. Coprolalia (cursing) occurs in a VERY SMALL number of TS patients and is not a requirement for a diagnosis.

If your child has TS, the most important thing to do for him is to provide a safe, stress free (as much as possible) home environment where he is allowed to tic without comment from others.  Unconditional acceptance is imperative.

We got the diagnosis at age 9.  Symptoms really started to kick in at 7-8.  Little things started at 4.  He is now almost 12 and is doing great.  He is sweet, loving and a great kid.  He has a high IQ, plays chess, builds advanced Lego sets, makes stop-motion animation movies on his iMac and it artistically gifted.  I would not trade him for the world.  

You are blessed to have a Pediatrician who gives the referral to a Neurologist right away!  I had to switch pediatricians until someone listened!  My road to diagnosis was rocky.  I hope that my journey will be a help to you in yours.  Blessing and prayers for a good outcome.",Tourettes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know if he picked it up, if it is a nervous habit or if he really has Tourette.",double blinking,,,,,,,,Has anyone else ever dealt with this?

When i eat only veg based products I have minimal flare up?

Has anyone else found a similar intolerance in them or relatives? It seem silly to me, can only be certain Nutrients that are in meat products?????

THANKS","Hello,

I had Ulcerative Colitis & Proctitis six years ago and cured myself without western medications. Proctitis & ulcerative colitis are both serious digestive conditions which affect the colon and bowel. Crohns is a chronic digestive condition which also affects the colon, all of these conditions respond very positively to a process of food elimination.

YES! MEAT !! is a no! no! if you have Crohns why? because meat is extremely hard work for the colon to deal with and so removing meat & meat products from your diet will definately help your colon & condition (symptoms of the Crohns).

1065636,Has anyone ever been diagnosed with Compartment Syndrome?,"I am a runner who has been diagnosed with bilateral compartment syndrome in my lower legs.  I am currently seeing a specialist, as well as recieving therapy a few times a week.  The thing is, I am finding that the stretching and exercises that I have been shown to do feel like they are worsening my injury rather then improving it. Has anyone else ever worked through this injury, and if so, do you have any tips on how to decrease the pain associated with working out/ training/ living!?","did your doctors explain to you what the pain was being caused by? It is generally due to an increase in pressure within the compartment of muscles on the anterior aspect of the lower leg. There is not a lot of give in the sheaths holding the muscles together so an exercise level you are not used to, or even a new exercise may cause swelling in the anterior muscles, increasing the pressure.

In some extreme cases, surgery is required to remove the pressure as blood vessels and nerves to the area can become damaged, a side effect of which is necrotic tissue (tissue that has died due to a lack of oxygen). Your doctors should have already addressed this with you, but if not and your pain continues, bring it up with them. As if the inflammation continues, you could get septicemia which is deadly.

You could try an ice pack after doing your stretches to decrease the swelling, or elevating your legs above heart level. I would also talk to your specialist and tell them of your concerns. It may be they might have to manipulate the stretches for you, or the stretches may not be right for the current stage in recovery you are in.

During the day, anti-inflammatory drugs may also help. Check before taking these though if you are a competitive athlete as some may be on the banned list!

Keep in mind, this may all be a normal part of the healing process as you are working already inflamed muscles.!.

It is not caused by putting pressure on the skin.  I have had blood tests done, everything comes out normal, including my thyroid. I don't have any (known) infections, internal or external.

I have had chronic urticaria as long as I can remember (I'm 20) My allergist couldn't even do an allergy test on me because just being poked, even without an allergen on the needle, caused me to break out.  I have been taking ranitidine and singulair for the past year, and it has been helping, although it has not cured it.  Try taking benedryl before you go to bed. It is a anti-histamine, which will help the hives, and it will make you sleepy also. I wouldn't recommend doing that long-term though. I only do it when I am absolutely desperate for sleep.  If you are allergic to any foods, it could just take a while for your system to react to it, so watch what you eat for dinner, or go on a elimination diet if you strongly think that food is the cause.

If they are not finding anything on scans, that is good news. 

The CA marker does not confirm anything.  A high result like yours can also be caused by an infection.  Benign conditions which can elevate CA 125 include infections of the lining of the abdomen and chest (peritonitis and pleuritis), menstruation, pregnancy, endometriosis, and liver disease. Benign tumors of the ovaries can also cause an abnormal test result. Because CA-125 can be high in many normal or benign conditions it is not useful as a screening test in large populations.

I think if something were malignant, it would be a higher result - over 60.

534237,Endometriosis and hysterectomy???,"I had severe endometriosis for years and got a hysterectomy (they took everything) when I was 25 (ten years ago).  However, for the past few years I have been having moderate to severe cramps, getting worse all the time.  I even told my friend I felt like I was going to start my period.  I just read that hysterectomies don't necessarily cure endometriosis, especially if your doc leaves some in you when you have your hysterectomy, which mine did.  It makes sense to me that it would take this long for my cramps to become severe again, as the disease would need time to grow.  Has anyone had this same experience, or similar?  I am really stressed about it.  Especially since I heard that it is not only possible but common.  My hysterectomy was totally worth it to me because my pain and hormone imbalance was so severe.  But now that I am in pain again, I just don't know.  I am a little scared because I don't want to go through this again.  Even though I already have been for a few years.  Wow, does this even make sense???","Now for a sensible answer that doesn't contain erroneous information recommending futile treatments or try to sell you supplements:

There is no definitive cure for Endometriosis, hysterectomy included.  Because Endo makes its own estrogen synthesizing enzyme, called aromatase, it is able to sustain its own life cycle even after hysterectomy.  If there is any disease left behind, it will continue to cause symptoms, period.  You need to have it removed via excision by an expert, such as Dr. David Redwine at www.endometriosistreatment.org or Dr. Albee at the Center for Endo Care in Atlanta at www.centerforendo.com.  Those specialists use excision - not ablation, vaporization or other superficial removal - and routinely excise all disease from all locations, including bowels, bladder, ureterus and other advanced areas.

I was there for just over a month, and that was over 6 months ago, and I have had a stuffy nose everday since I first got down there.  I'm sure I was exposed to all kinds of polutants.  But I'm not usually the type of person who gets sick easily, but I've had this stuffy nose for over 6 months and it won't go away.  Towards the end people were tearing out the walls of their homes, and the streets were lined with fiberglass insulation, and I assume asbestos.  My girlfriends parents said they heard a news reporter who was down there talk about how she's had a stuffy nose for months now too.  Has this happened to anyone else who was down there?  And did it go away, or am I doomed to live like this for the rest of my life?","I ended up going to the doctor and getting anti-fungal pills to take.  He ex-rayed my face and there were pockets of stuff in my sinuses.  Everyone I know is complaining of stuffy nose, sinus infection, Katrina cough, sore throats, etc.  You are not doomed. Just get to a doctor and describe what's going on.  Since I took those anti-fungals, I feel much better.  Part of the problem is the mold.  Everything that got wet molded, and with people gutting out their homes, there is all sorts of mold being released into the air.  I wouldn't worry so much about asbestos as the mold.  Also be warned, many of these old houses have layers of lead paint, so lead is also being released.  

This problem will last for quite a while, as a lot of people STILL have not returned to gut their homes.

Another factor for you and others from other areas is the humidity.  If you aren't used to the level of humidity we have here, that could be making you feel even worse.

My fiance and I have been together and lived to gether over a year - but being told not to come around hurt-- and now that his treatments are over he's different, and his family is still 'weird' if that makes sense... I don't know what to do about--- My fiance tells me to be patient a little longer< that he feels secure in our relationship, but then he stands me up Thanksgiving with his family","I work in a chemo ward, and I see the things that families do to each other when one of them is diagnosed with cancer;
I have seen partners shut out and isolated, I have seen people at each other's throats; everyone wants to be close to the patient; everyone wants to protect him.
Your fiancee has been through a life changing event. He looks at life differently now. It must be very hard for you to be sidelined like this. How cruel of his family to shut you out at this time; this doesn't bode well for your future married life together.
Write to his family; say you would like the opportunity to clear the air - that you love him very much, and that you want to be part of his life - the bad bits as well as the good bits. Try not to allocate blame; and try not to be self pitying when you speak to them.
It sounds like your fiancee made his decision when he moved back in with them; I wonder why he felt he had to do that? For the moment, you may have to take his word that things are ok between you.
I would think that things are not ok.
You are supposed to be his bride-to-be; you are on the verge of married life together. I wonder about his level of committment to you if he ran home when trouble raised it's head.
Sorry to be a devil's advocate here, but I would not be happy with that situation at all.
Treatment does change people; families often close ranks against those whom they consider to be """"outsiders"""". Still, I think they are being unesscessarily cruel here. Was there some conflict between you and them before his illness?Do they not approve of you for some reason?

238160,Help! How do  I get my 6 yr old son to pay attention in school?,"My son is 6, almost 7 and he has developmental delays. He was never classified as autistic or having PDD, all we were ever told was he has a speech delay. My husband, inlaws, myself and his teacher and speech therapist are concerned with his inability to pay attention. He daydreams and """"plays"""" video games in class (moves his hands and fingers like he's holding a controller). The teacher hasn't said it but I think she's thinking ADD or something similar. I've talked to friends with kids similar ages and they all say their kids do the same thing so I know part of it is just my son being a normal 6 year old. The problem he faces is when he drifts he risks getting lost and not being able to grasp what the rest of the class is working on. How can I teach him to stay focused on the task at hand and how to bring himself back when he does drift? Are there games we can play with him? He does watch too much tv, and I know I need to do something about that.","Honestly, you seem to have a pretty rough idea of what you need to do. Just stick with what you are doing and cut the cable off, and maybe take away the games. Just for a few months and see if he improves at school.

Yes, you are right. You do have a normal six year old boy. You could also try using some other sort of methods to increase his attention span.

1) TV Time Needs To Be Trimmed - A child's attention span only lasts about 8 to 10 minutes. Funny that 8 to 10 minutes is how long a television program is on for until it breaks for commercial.

2) Games and Gadgets - When it comes to game systems, just remove them from the picture. Two ways to do so, A) Take them from him while he is either using them or is around or B) Move them into a place where only you know the whereabouts when he is at school.

Some might also suggest using educational games to help but I have found that t defeats the purpose of taking away games all together. Besides, he needs to learn to stay focused and not get better hand eye coordination. Maybe to hone some math or english skills, but not for what you're dealing with right now.

1320005,eating disorders?,"this might sound like an odd/stupid question, but how do you know when you really have an eating disorder?...im only asking this because my parents think i have an eating disorder but im not, according to them im in 'denial' but i do eat...but i do admit when i was younger (in elementary school) i tend to have eaten a bit more than now...but it isnt like im straving myself i do eat when im hungry...how can i tell my parents im perfectly fine and i dont have an eating problem!!
thanxs to anyone who responds...
much love; caroline <3 xoxox","Caroline, you sound like a real sweetie :) The way you can tell if you have an eating disorder is if you find yourself constantly obsessing with calories and with your weight. 
If you eat , but you in eat in very small amounts, if you find yourself purging (eating and then vomiting or taking laxatives) ANother thing is if you avoid certain foods because you are constantly afraid of fat intake. For example you are afraid of eating a hamburger because you think it will make you fat. 

People that have eating disorders are constantly afraid of getting fat, they are constantly obesessing with calories, they eat very little, they only eat certain foods For example, some lady on here was telling us that she ate nothing but cantelope and drank water and could not figure out why she wasn't losing weight. Basically you have a fear of eating because you don't want to get fat

When I was a kid, I went through a phase of not eating breakfast. I just didn't want to, I would get up and I wasn't hungry, but I had to  learn to eat it because if I didn't I would get terrible stomachaches. When I was 14 I just completely lost my appetite and I was getting terribly skinny and it worried my mom so she was giving me my favorite foods to help me regain my appetite. 

YOu didn't ask an odd or stupid question. Maybe ...you should suggest that your parents and you go to counseling so that you can get this resolved or maybe you should suggest that they get some information on eating disorders. I know that it must be frustrating for you. They are just concerned parents. Maybe a little counseling will help you guys or maybe learning about the true facts together. 

They just may be overly concerned feeling that you should eat more or something. I don't know

I am bipolar and suffer from serious panic/anxiety disorder but can't stay on the meds. Too expenisve!!! I am a mom of 3 lil ones and a script for $300 a month is just not in the plan!! Any of you cope with out meds? there are times I try. All i hear from everyone is "" its all in your head"" and so I try to focus and deal and calm myself and there are times I jsut feel so out of control and lost and scared and just basically in adownward spiral.","First and foremost pray and then start looking for information to help you with anxiety attacks because the Bible says Seek and you WILL (not may) find .Believe me, having been through anxiety attacks I know how motivated you are to get help. I believe you will get help and I am on your side in the battle.

It is very important to do this with the guidance of a trained Psychologist or Psychiatrist but there are ways to cope with this problem without medication in many instances.

Often panic attacks are the result of some kind of psychological trauma. In my case I almost died from a heart problem. Most of my life I have not had them but when I did they were doozies. You must guard against incompetent Medical people. In my case the Dr. prescribed enough of a drug in the same class as Valium (can't remember the name now) to sedate a horse. These drugs do not address the underlying problem although in some severe cases may be necessary. The benzodiazapenes such as Valium and Xanax are addictive. The only drug I take now is a drug that regulates the heartbeat.

Be particularly careful about the Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors such as Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil. Again in extreme cases they may be necessary and regardless always go with a Doctor's advice(just make sure they are competent). What I am stating is my own opinion derived from personal experience but it is well founded since I am well now and was at one point a basket case. I had a very bad experience with Zoloft, promptly quit and don't need it.

Heres what I found:

Don't laugh, but many times anxiety attacks are caused by hyperventilating. When you hyperventilate you are actually changing the chemical composition of the blood. It is a vicious spiral because the more you get anxious the more you hyperventilate which makes you more anxious ad infinitum. I am not talking about conciously hyperventilating but rather hyperventilation you are not necessarily aware of, basically improper and shallow breathing. A good site that explains it is http://www.healthyplace.com/Communities/anxiety/christine/treatment_breathing_techniques.htm

Sometimes if you will slow the rate at which you breathe and breathe from your diaphragm, you can mitigate your anxiety. Babies breathe from their bellies, adults and sometimes even children breathe in a shallow manner not extending their bellies out as they take in a breath.  Due to the excessive levels of stress all around us we become desensitized and don't even realize how much we have been affected. I remember going out into the country and for awhile the extreme quiet got on my nerves until I got used to it and then what an incredible good feeling came over me.

There is another technique for dealing with the acute portions of an anxiety attack. There is a book by Dr. Claire Weekes called Hope and Help for your Nerves. She talks about the 4 stages (1 Facing 2)Accepting 3) Floating 
4) Letting time pass . I highly recommend that you purchase her book . For me, the facing part is acknowledgeing that even though you feel as if you will die and it is extremely uncomfortable , you will not likely die. The accepting part is just acknowledging that since you will not likely die you can accept your condition. This becomes easier as the severity of the attacks begin to lessen. 3) Floating for me was a process of stepping outside of myself and observing objectively what was going on 4) Letting time pass is facilitated by realizing that the attack will diminish over time . This realization allows you to become occupied doing something else. I am by no means  a trained Psychologist but the techniques worked for me and I am definitely well now and I think it is possible you will be too. 

Oh and be sure to get a complete medical workup.

massage my back/neck well to improve the circulation when it hurts

3210137,Swollen foot?,"Ok, this is a very odd situation so let me explain:
I am in my late 20's, and my right foot has been slightly swollen for about 8 years now.  At first I didn't get it checked out because I was in school and couldn't afford health insurance (don't you love our country's priorities?).  Over the last couple of years I have been to several different types of doctors and noone seems to know what is wrong.  Here are some of the things I've heard:
My regular dr did blood work and bone scan....nothing.
A podiatrist did an x-ray....nothing.
A vascular surgeon examined it and said it maybe Venus [something] syndrom where the valves in my leg don't let the blood through...but he wasn't sure.
I had my legs scanned by a sonagram technichian and she said there is a thickening of the outer vein in both legs that was maybe caused by a previous blood clot...but wasn't sure.  She said I didn't have to worry about blood clots (of course I asked).
I have never had any pain or discolorization. ideas?","Because it is one leg only it seems to relate to the energy flow on the affected side.  Think of any possible cause of this condition. Check your posture in the mirror--are you favouring one leg? In school this can happen easily when one carries heavy knapsacks on one shoulder. Emotionally the right side of our body relates to the male energy.  What issue can you connect with the swelling , what happened in your life around the time the swelling started? There is a reason for everything. It might sound silly but ask your body for a cause and for a remedy before you go to sleep.  Expect an answer to come and it will soon. Good luck!
In addition, there a few things you can do to improve blood circulation in your feet;
Please change the type of socks you wear--Pure cotton, or pure wool are best, no elastic and  no nylon. Also try to elevate the foot above the heart level several times a day. Make sure you do not cross your feet while sitting or lying in bed.  Drink, preferably boiled water at room temperature, often enough to keep your pee colourless and free of smell.  Reduce yeast in your diet. Make sure your nostrils are free and allow for an equal air supply--close one nostril and inhale deeply then exhale, in a few times, then out a few times. Repeat with other nostril. try leg stretches at least twice a day.  Every bit helps.  Expect your body to find a way to correct the condition soon.

I can't begin to imagine what it must be like.

Vasculitis is an inflammation of the blood vessels.  It's most often an immune or allergic reaction.  The white blood cells invade and damage the walls of the blood vessels.  The vessel walls swell, so the inside of the vessels become smaller and blood flow is reduced as a result.  It is usually a symptom of a disease, when it occurs in adults.  It is not necessarily deadly, but it can be at times, depending on which vessels are irritated.

With a baby, my first thought would be, genetic testing to see if you're predisposed to passing on defective genes that could cause such a thing.  I would also request copies of the medical records, and read them.  You'll probably need to use a search engine to look up medical terms as you read.  If you have a medical professional available, a doctor or nurse in your family, church group, the spouse of a colleague... ask them for help.  If you really feel that your doctors are not giving you enough answers, get a new doctor or midwife, contact Planned Parenthood, whatever you have to do, and ask for help.  If you have bad or no insurance, doctors might not see you, but most midwives will talk and answer questions for free.

Chances are, though, the baby was just fine at the last checkup before you had the pain.  Chances are that pain was the symptom of the vasculitis producing a blood clot, that probably was when the baby died.  There was probably nothing that could be done, unfortunately.  But you still have a right to know, and understand, all of what's happened.  Don't stop until you get your answers.",unborn baby died,,Female,,i have always wanted children,unborn baby died,,,i don't want to lose another baby,unborn baby died,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,i need some ansewers please help me find out.,Yes: I'm sorry for your loss.

2205997,Please help!!!! I am trying to understand ADD?,"I think I might have ADD and that I had it my whole life. I did few tests and all of them say I do. At the same time when I read books, I am sometimes not always convinced that this isa seperate Disorder. They say ADD people have a tendency to be addictive, they have low
self-esteem, disorganized, impulsive... That could be anybody with another mental illness.  I mean bipolar, Borderline Personalities.... can also have addictive tendencies, act on impulse, lack judjment... Many so called """"normal"""" people are messy, lack organization... I am quite familiar with mental illness since I have few of them. I am just trying to understand when you have ADD, in what way your brain functions differently. What makes it so that you consider this a disorder. I am a bit confused. I would really love to hear from people who have the illness/insiders rather than to try to understand or interpret books on ADD. Please share your own experiences, I already have checked all the ADD websites. Thank you all.","I was diagnosed with AD/HD a few months ago and like you I was skeptical.  I have a few mental illnesses as well so many of the same questions were running around in my mind as well.  I think it's when you have a lot of the symptons.  I know people who are lazy and disorganized but that is because they choose to be.  AD/HD people just can't grab the concept.  We try our best to do it and it's a real struggle.  The one that hit me was the concentration one.  I say ignorance is bliss!  I could do three things at once and easily jump back and forth, if I got distracted I just happily went off to what ever distracted me and came back to what I was doing, if I couldn't remember what I was doing oh well!  After I was diagnosed I was trying really hard to write an email and was concentrating so hard to make sure I got everything in there that I needed too.  The phone kept going off and my YM messenger kept blinking and I was distracted and couldn't remember what I was doing!  It is frustrating when you know you have to try really hard to concentrate and you still can't!!

I realized I self medicated in school and still do! (In college)  I take a big soda with me into classes so I can stay focused.  If I don't have that caffeine I am fidgety and am unable to focus on what I need to.  My mind wonders.

The way I understand it, so far since I am still learning, is that our brains don't have the stimulators that everyone else does, at least not as many, and our minds are searching for outside stimulation to get what it needs.  That's why stimulators such as caffeine and ridolin have the opposite effect they give our brain the stimulation it craves and we are able to focus on what we need to other than it reving us up.

I haven't recieved any medications for AD/HD yet because I'm slightly apprehensive about it making me drowsy and I love the high energy that I have.  I believe that the high energy is just who I am as a person and the AD/HD just adds a little something to it.

I know many AD/HD people are highly creative and they go off their meds when they need to be creative.  I'm also afraid my creativity will suffer from it.

When I was pregnant with my second after having a healthy, full-term baby the first time, I started to dilate at 24 weeks.

My doctor (who was not good) did not explain to me that I may only be 3 cm dilated, but my baby's head was only 6 cm in diameter...so I didn't have to be 10 cm to deliver.  He also did not explain to me that every day missed in the womb takes a weeks to make up outside the womb.  The neonatal intensive care unit staff informed me of these things.

I stayed five weeks in the hospital on bed rest.  My baby girl was born at 29 1/2 weeks gestation.  She weighed 3 lbs 2 ozs and was 15 in long.  She did well, but I vowed I would do anything and everything to make up for the pain she went through struggling just to breathe.

People think (deans and psychologists at my college) that I should do it more inconspicuously, but I have to do it where I think about doing it--like I had to cut my wrists and I couldn't cut anywhere else because that wouldn't have eliminated the thought for me.  I also have frequent thoughts of suicide, with no intent--when I talk about this, my suicidality is not distinguished from my self-injury--how can I explain they are different things?  And how can I explain that it is a compulsion?  I've tried to say this many times, but I keep getting lectured on the standards of a community, and am told basically flat-out to stop it--which I can't.  So yes, if anyone could help me explain my self-injury that would be appreciated.  Also any medical advice?  Kind of therapist/type of medications good for this?","Well, I know exactly what you are saying, and I wish I could actually put into words for you what you are trying to get out. The best thing I could say to do would be to go to http://www.psyke.org/ and read some of the information they have posted. Your own self harm may make more sense once you understand it better. The coping page is very good, I got most of my ideas from there.

Basicly, you don't want to die. You want to live. The only way you can live is by coping with your pain. Since you have been participating in self harm for so long you don't know any other way to cope than to hurt yourself. You haven't said whether you want to stop or not, only that you can't stop. People tend to group the two together because they assume that to do either you must be depressed and therefor the two must be related. People lecturing you and telling you to stop isn't going to do anything. To stop YOU have to want to stop. If you can get up the courage to go to a therapist they may be able to have you evaluated and see if there is a medication of any kind which could cut down on feelings that make you want to cut, but this won't stop them alltogether. It is going to take work on your part to stop this. You may want to consider seeing a therapist, or finding another way to cope with this. Or both.

There is so much more to say but I don't know how to say it! I wish you the best of luck getting through this. If you do have to cut make sure you use clean blades and wash out the cut, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I've tried to say this many times, but I keep getting lectured",deans and psychologists,,,,,,if anyone could help me explain my self-injury,"Yes: I know exactly what you are saying, and I wish I could actually put into words for you what you are trying to get out."
1522344,Acne mark/scars?,"I'm not sure what they are called, they're the ugly marks the zits leave behind after they're gone, and it's even harder to get rid of! I have TONS of these on my face, and it's really just bad looking when I look close... (Don't get me wrong, you can clearly see them from a distance too, but it's just uglier close-up).

At the moment, I'm using ProActiv. I admit, it cleared away most pimples (even though I still got one or two every now and then), but I really don't see any changes in the marks. FYI, I've been using ProActiv for about a week, so I may have to wait longer, but I have yet to see any """"dramatic"""" results they gauranteed.

If anyone could share some sort of products or methods they use to clear away the marks, it would be much appreciated. They're really ugly.","I know exactly what you are talking about. I'm experiencing the same thing too (they DO look bad from distance or angle), and I'm trying to get rid of them as well. Thing is, I think they're just like any scar you would get anywhere on your body. They'll go away eventually. Proactiv, which I've used (I'm just finishing my second, and last set now) contains a chemical that is bleaching to fabric, and I would assume that same chemical is what'll help fade the marks (though they didn't work for me after the first set, and now finishing my second, they're a bit faded, but still there - keep in mind that everyone's skin is different).

So my suggestion would be to look for other products that are meant for Blemish control/Blemish Fighting. However, if you know that you have sensitive skin, don't use anything else in combination Proactiv. It may cause a reaction. And also, for future reference, within the Proactiv line there is a product called 'Advanced Blemish Treatment'. It works very well if used correctly. You know when you know you're about to get a pimple, and the area gets a bit redish and sore-ish...like the warning sign? If you apply a thin layer of it right then, there's a good chance that the pimple will not even develop, and will leave virtually no mark at all. If you have the funds in order, I would suggest you buy it. It's the only Proactiv product I plan to continue to buy. It costs $33 in Canada.... so whereever you're from, do the math. lol.

Birth control helps a LOT of women, and I wouldn't necessarily give up on it (unless you are trying to get pregnant, obviously) but it is not a universal cure for what ails you.  It conceals your symptoms... it does not treat the underlying issue.

Unless you have a diagnosis for why your periods are so difficult (Endometriosis, PID, Ovarian Cysts, Fibroids... lots of options, and it's not possible to diagnose over the web) then your doctor should not be just dismissing your problems with """"birth control"""" as if that is the only cure.

I was also taking Gonal F and Pergonyl with Progesterone supposatories at the end of my cycle.

The success rate varies from fertility clinic to fertility clinic and depends on each couple and their fertility stats.  My doctor told me that I had a 30% chance of getting pg every month.  Which is a lot higher than the regular pregnancy rate!

BTW, it was the hugely botched cycle that I conceived on!  So, even if it isn't perfectly timed (we were off by THREE days) you still have a chance.  Just keep getting busy!

You do sound like you may have some depression and/or anxiety issues. The good thing is that you have already started the road to recovery by reaching out for help. Both depression and anxiety are very curable. I have had both of these, and counseling really helped me. 

Please know that when you are feeling like this is part of being down, and that things can get better. Your fears of not being good enough are very common to people who are depressed and people in general! I don't think there are many people who have not privately felt that they are not """"good enough"""".  Self confidence can be learned. In the meantime, be gentle to yourself - you deserve it.

If you do not have benefits at work, there are some non-profit agencies if money is an issue. Some faith communities have trained counselors as well.  If you have a good relationship with your family doctor, you could also talk to them about this and see if they have some referrals.

if you need any additional details plz ask but help me. doctors here in pakistan are pathetic i can't go for an ultrasound or blood test again & again...",You could be pregnant but then again there is always the chance that the home test was wrong.  They will give you false positives but almost never give you false negative answers.  Your period being late could have been from many things.  Stress being the most common factor.  The abdominal pain could be cramps that as associated with the menstral cycle. If the doctors test and the blood test say negative wait for a couple of days and then try another home test and see what it says.  Now as far as the sickness and tender breasts a lot of girls get that with their period.  The dizziness sometimes comes along with  a period because of the blood loss during that time.

The blisters irritate me and interefere with my daily activities as the pain until they are cleared becomes unberable. The skin specialist whom I consulted said there is no cure and there is no medicine even for the pain. I take pain killers with the risk of the side effects involved.

311853,I'm just 16 and i have Graves disease. Is there anyone in the same condition like me? What about my future?,"I've been having treatment since Dec 2005 and right now i'm like in the hyper phase. I'm fully aware about all the medication&treatment stuff and the alternatives. But i have no idea if this disease is cured, will there be any hard conditions in future when i wanna have baby etc? also my doctor says that it is not common to have Graves in my age. is there anyone in the same situation and wanna give me soeme advice? what does your m.d. tell?i'm just too curious..","Hi!  Onset of my Grave's began at 15 but was asymptomatic (to the doctors) until age 22, when I demanded a blood test (I thought I was dying).  You see, I weighed 85 lbs. on my high school graduation day and looked anorexic.  Grave's had developed when I first menstruated, so I never had a steady period.  That, my weight, and my althleticism led the docs to think I was just slow to develop or too athletic for regular menstruation.  

Anyway, upon a blood tests they found massive Grave's, gave me the meds, and all went well.  I went into remission about 1 year after the diagnosis at age 23.  I grew an inch taller and developed breasts (what a wonderful concept) that year as well.  I finally developed fat cells, long awaited, at age 25 and looked a healthy weight from then onward.

Yes, you can have children, but please wait until you are in remission from the Grave's.  You really don't want to be playing with Grave's when you are pregnany, since that's an additional factor which must be considered.

My advice is be patient with the whole process.  They have to first determine the best treatments ... I say treatments because for me it was PTU, which turned out not to work, to tapazol, which did work.  Had that not worked, we would have got to the subpartial thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine procedure.  You'll have monthly blood tests, enough to know your phlebotomist by name each time.  

No, it's not common to develop Grave's at your age.  I'd never met anyone (until I just talked to you) who had developed it like me.  BUT ... I have to tell you, be very thankful it has been found!  I went through 7 years of thinking I was going crazy, stupid doctor-prescribed weight gain diets, being forbidden from any exercise whatsoever (I'd lose too much weight), and unexplained emergency room visits for malnutrition (and I ate like a horse).  So, knowing what it is is half the battle.  Now you just have to figure out how you'll manage the next year being patient.  You will get better ... you're not """"cured"""" but you can go into remission.  

I went into remission at age 23, had monthly blood tests for a while (still in remission), then graduated to six months (still in remission) then went to yearly (still in remission).  About 8 years later, my doctor didn't want to do the blood test, since he said I was fine.  I insisted, since I have an abiding fear of Grave's, and it's a good thing I did. I now have Hashimoto's, the exact opposite of Grave's.  I am hypo and take replacement thyroid hormone.

According to the research I did on Grave's, the docs aren't sure where the Grave's antibody comes from, but it looks like thyroid disorders can run in families, which was my case (I have 4 maternal aunts and my mother with thyroid issues).  Further, there is some indication that the thyroid comes with a shelf life, which is what I think is occuring with me.  With the way it went unchecked for so long (I was almost in thyroid storm, my numbers were so high -- the doc didn't know how I was alive), my thyroid really went into overdrive.  What if it can operate that way for only so long?  Anyway, that's the premise I operate on today, that the Grave's is gone forever and Hashimoto's is here to stay. My endocrinologist told me not to make such absolute statements, but I think the thyroid I have is dying slowly ... I'd much rather this than Grave's since Grave's is so insidious with me.

Anyhow, I am now 38 and that's my story.  I hope it makes you feel a bit better that it can happen to teens.  You also need to be vigilant from now on, telling docs you need that blood test just to be safe, etc.  You WILL go into remission, one way or the other, and there are no real bad effects later on from this, as long as you keep on top of it.  You'll want to continue drinking milk and exercising, since the latest studie",Graves disease,,,NA,,,,,"But i have no idea if this disease is cured, will there be any hard conditions in future when i wanna have baby etc?",Graves disease,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,,,,will there be any hard conditions in future when i wanna have baby etc?,,,,is there anyone in the same situation and wanna give me soeme advice?,"Yes: Anyhow, I am now 38 and that's my story.

I know the obivous answer is """"see a doctor"""", but currently I live in a consertative Muslim country where STD testing is not very common and is generally frowned upon.  

I do have the option of going to a private hospital, but they tend to be very expensive. If need be, I will pay what ever is necessary, but is there anyway I can do a self diagnosis?

Is it possible this could be something else?","If it's just one, it's probably not genital warts. They tend to come in clusters and will spread around your penis. The solution is to have then burned off with liquid nitrogen. This can take several treatments, and if they aren't all removed they may re-occur.

Other symptoms that are sometimes confused as genital warts are molluscum contagiosum (another sexually transmittable disease) and fordyce spots (not a disease at all.)

The best thing to do is see a doctor ASAP. Only a doctor can provide an accurate diagnosis. If the private hospital is your only option, then go there. But it's better to know the truth, and if treatment is neccesary to start early.

It is the end product of any abnormality (usually occurred or present since birth or very early childhood) where the normal blood supply to the brain has been disturbed (i.e. a stroke).  The appearance of small irregular blood vessels within the brain is the body's response to try and get blood to the brain the best way it can in the absence of normal arteries.  The surgical treatment options available all try to provide alternative routes of blood delivery to the brain.  These are collectively bypass procedures, or synangiosis procedure.  Synangiosis can be done differently, but the the basic principle is to try and recruit outer blood vessels in the head (i.e. scalp blood vessels) to feed the brain.

A person typically produces 50 ml or more of urine an hour. an output of 1-3 liters a day is considered normal as long as it is within 600 ml of input ( this accounts for insatiable loss) If you have a small bladder and/or you drink a lot of fluid than this output is absolutely normal (dont forget not everyone has huge bladders and a bladder is nothing more than a baloon created by muscle some people have bladders that can hold large amounts(a liter or more) and some are small holding only a few hundred ml at a time before causing discomfort.

Now i was diagnosed with another rare liver disorder called ""primary billary cirrhosis"" (it doesn't differ much from the first illness i described) Fortunately I am still stage one and have no or little symptoms. Maybe someone can tell more about the effects of diet coke or tylenol?

diet products are not harmful to the liver, and have not been proven to be harmful to human in any way (except those with phenylketonuria). the most common claim is that they cause cancer, which is false (see the link below). there is no way for them to ""clog up"" your body or urinary tract.

you are right to be concerned with taking tylenol or any product containing acetominophen (many cold remedies have it). tylenol can be fatal to anyone if they take too much, and the cause of death is liver failure. 

you are definitely a special case, with multiple liver disorders AND allergies to other pain meds. you really need to call your gastroenterologist and ask them whta the maxiumum dose of tylenol you should have is. if the transplanted liver is functionally normally, you should be able to take it, although I can understand wanting to be extra careful with your gift.",effects of diet coke or tylenol,,,,,,,,am wondering if it damages your liver,diet coke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Maybe someone can tell more about the effects of diet coke or tylenol?,Yes: you are right to be concerned

Depends what kind it is, the underlying cause and if there is coronary heart disease or any type of cardiomyopathy. There is a good method of mapping your heart during an electrophysiology study which is called ESI. What this does it inflates a ballon insite the right atrium and it has a ""net"" on it. The net comes in contact with the myocardium thus mapping it and can pinpoint where the arrhythmias are generating from. What an ablation does is that it ""burns"" the site or the group of cells that are causing the arrhythmia, however another group of cells with time or progresive disease can become irritable and start arrhythmias, or there can be another reentry pathway in your heart that can be causing the problem. The atria and ventricles are supposed to be electrically isolated from each other and with the existance of these re-entry pathways the action potential or electricity generated in the atria (or anywhere) can just travel back and forth and cause a rapid heart beat. If you live in NY the best place to have this done would be at St. Francis Hospital- The Heart Center (516-562-6000) by Dr. Greenberg or one of his associates.",arrhythmia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,it should never come back again right?.,ablation,,,,,,,chear me up,,,maybe we can talk on the phone,No

The best way I can advise to deal with it is to just simply walk away or if it is mostly your spouse, maybe counseling for both of you is in order. My husband used to really push my buttons. Once he """"thinks"""" he is no longer getting a reaction, it should mellow out. I have been with my spouse for almost 20 years and it took me a long time to figure that out. I decided when I was 33 (I am now 41)that I was not going to live like that anymore. Most of the time my """"buttons get pushed"""" is when he has had a few drinks and starts to be a complete idiot.

I found it very difficult to communicate with other people or even join in in their world. I went to Grammar School as the 11+ could tell latent intelligence but teachers at both my junior school and the grammar dismissed it as a 'fluke'.

I realise that I could never understand a lot about certain subjects until I'd left school as they had always taught me how to do things rather than why we did them in the first place and how to apply them to everyday life.

Everything was either black or white and there were no shades of grey inbetween and I'm ashamed to say that after Leeds United beat Arsenal in the 1971 FA Cup, the Leeds goalkeeper looked like he was seriously hurt and I said 'good' as there was no such thing as healthy rivalry and Leeds being against Arsenal were the enemy, pure and simple in my mind.

After the 'nurrr!' comments at school when I asked a question which I didn't know the answer to but was supposedly common knowledge, I just gave up asking and only realised the relevance of any school subjects to real life in my late teens.

Computers came into my life when I was 17 in 1979, took away my job but I found out that this was a subject which I really had a flair for, although I had to do a completely different course every two years or so due to the speedy obsolescence of computer systems in the '80s.

During that time, I developed an interest in politics and the media and by the late 80s, Media Studies was becoming an ascendent subject. I took a Diploma in I.T. in the early 90s and passed with 3 Distinctions and progressed quickly to a Media Studies degree at University.

I've worked at the Royal Greenwich Observatory and won a Koestler award for Best new entry: Scriptwriting for Television and Radio. People get on with me beautifully and they love my rapier-like and spontaneous wit and admire my creative works and ambitions.

I always believed I was better than the scrapheap that they'd condemned me to, I've been listed as having an IQ of 185 by Mensa and I never stop working towards my dreams, no matter how unattainable they seem. I'm nearly 44 now and happy with my life, although it took a lot of being bullied, going daily from one living hell to another to another after that with no joy inbetween. I conquered the drink problem I suffered from so that I only drink socially and sensibly nowadays.

It'll be a long hard road, uphill all the way for your son and especially for you. Always encourage any creativity he shows and you'll be amazed. Talk to him about how he feels, don't put words in his mouth but see if you can get him out of his shell to tell you about his frustration at not being able to understand or communicate properly.

Nurture him well and hopefully, quicker than it took me, you'll have an amazing son that you'll be proud of and everyone will agree with that pride.

Endometriosis is the presence of normal endometrial mucosa (glands and stroma) ABNORMALLY implanted in locations OTHER than the uterine cavity. This tissue, possessing the same steroid receptors as normal endometrium, is capable of responding to the normal cycles of hormones. One theory of spread is thought to be dispersion of ectopic (meaning where it should not be) inplants throughout the peritoneal cavity (area where your bowels, liver reside) during menstruation, since sloughing off of products of endometrial tissue from the uterus is not just unidirectional (out through the cervix then vagina, but also up through the fallopian tubes leading to the body cavity known as retrograde flow. This is common in women and can't fully explain endometriosis. Endometriosis has even been found on structures even above the diaphragm. Endometriosis responds and is driven by estrogen. There are reports of women with endometriosis occuring after hysterectomy and removal of the ovaries (which makes estrogens). Women normally continue to make lower levels of weaker estrogens even after their ovaries have been removed. Some women for whatever reason continue to make high levels, and this is thought to be a reason for further symptoms.

4081162,Newborn anxiety?,"So here is my story.... after 3 years of marriage and much discussion and planning, my husband and I decided to have a baby. Took all of one try (no kidding). Everything was fine up until week 24, I started having contractions and am now bed bound until our daughter arrives. So here I am, almost 29 weeks pregnant and attempting to register for my shower, and I just realized something. Our baby is going to be born, we are going to get her home.... and then what? I am chalking it up to hormones and the fact that this is our first baby, but just realized I am scared to death! Hubby has never really been around babies, the only experience I have is babysitting 10 years ago. I already love my daughter, I have loved her from the first day I found out I was pregnant... I don't want to screw her up! Please tell me some of you brand new parents have been through this!","Oh!  CONGRATULATIONS on your pregnancy.  I'm sorry to hear that you are on bedrest but I'm glad to hear you are taking care of yourself and doing what you need to do to finish baking her and bring her in safe and sound.

I was 31 when I had my first baby and 35 when I just had my third one.  So I was a bit older.  I had done a TON of babysitting in my younger days and my sister and I are 8 years apart and I did lots and lots of care for her when she was born and afterwards!

But yet..I was still completely terrified when it was my own baby.  Now *I* was responsible for raising this child and *I* was responsible for how it turns out as an adult.  HOW SCARY IS THIS????

But you know what?  I have to live and learn..make my mistakes..and move on.  And you will too.  

You might not be able to because of your bed rest but I recommend taking a child birth class.  If you can't do that then a Newborn basics class is pretty helpful.  It will teach you how to put on a diaper, bathe the baby, infant CPR, how to swaddle a baby (KEY if you want them to sleep better)--how often they need to be fed..just basic things for a happy, healthy, baby.

Even though the newborn stage is so difficult becuase of the lack of sleep..guess what?  That is the easy part!  It gets harder when they get older and then you have to start using redirection and discipline.  Then you really start questioning your parenting abilities!

So enjoy the newborn stage.  It goes REALLY REALLY REALLY fast.  

You really will be okay.  You are already ahead of the game!  You have your husband's support AND you already love your baby.  You will do just fine!

If you really want more input from others though--you can continue to do what you are already doing..research on the Internet.

There are great sites out there that helped me get through all three of my pregnancies.  Just knowing there are others out there who we can direct our questions to or just get moral support (newborns are HARD work!)is AWESOME!  There's two sites in particular that I will list below.  You can join the Birth club for the date that your baby is due and then you are all be pregnant at the same time and you can get to know these people over the span of the pregnancy and you can hear the birth stories of the people who are due ahead of you and then you can continue to network with these people and ask questions and get advice as the babies grow!  It also sends you week-by-week updates on what is happening with your baby during the pregnancy adn then what is hpapenign with the baby's develpoment once she's been born.  It's great.  

In addition to Internet resouces--Doctors are good resouces.  Some sites on the Internet are good resouces.  Other Mommies are good resources.  Your own Mom is a good resource (if she's still in your life).  You will be okay.

Make the appointment first, then make sure to write down ALL the food that he has had during the time period between making the appointment and going to it.  That way, you will have evidence of any reactions.  Also note if anything unusual is going on at home, if he is throwing tantrums, how frequent his stools are, and if he appears to have any reactions to any other foods.  I would not recommend specifically giving him foods that you think he may be allergic to... a true allergic reaction gets worse the more times you are exposed to it, so the outcome of giving him something he may be allergic to could be very harmful.

2875234,Side effects of hemorrhoidectomies?,"I hope I spelled it right.
I ask this question because I'm gay and I wanna know if after having hemorrhoids surgically removed, I'd still be able to have anal sex, if it would be painful or not, if I would bleed, if there's a chance of becoming impotent (as I read once), etc.
And another thing, while having the problem (not having yet the operation), what could happen if you have sex, and if you use lubricant?
Oh, and is """"Anusol"""" anything like Prep H? Cuz we don't have Prep H here but we do have Anusol.
Thanks a lot!","There is not a lot of info out there regarding what can happen after surgery.  You might search out a doctor who is comfortable talking about these issues.  Here is some info I found:

Anal sex shouldn't hurt. Having hemorrhoids can make anal sex painful. People who find anal sex painful often do not use enough water-based lube; others are not relaxed or aroused enough. Using lots of lube  which makes anal (and vaginal) sex more slippery and wet  can increase pleasure for both you and your partner. Relaxation will also minimize or prevent the possibility of tearing the thin lining of the rectum, and make insertion easier and more comfortable. Some people relax by taking a warm bath; others begin with a massage, starting with the butt and inner thighs, then gently playing in and around the anal sphincter with a finger. As the sensations become more comfortable and pleasurable, some people experiment by placing more fingers inside the anus. Others might progress to a small sex toy, or be ready to be penetrated by a larger toy, or even a penis. Communication with your partner about what feels good and how you want to be touched is essential for enjoyable anal play.

Although you can have anal sex when you have hemorrhoids, it's better to wait until they've healed. Friction and pressure from penetration can cause further irritation, discomfort, and pain. In addition, hemorrhoids that bleed may place you at increased risk for HIV infection, since the HIV virus can be transmitted more easily through an open """"cut"""" or """"wound."""" Whenever you have anal sex  if you have hemorrhoids or not  it's safer to use condoms and lube if you don't know your partner's HIV status.  http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1925.html?CFID=277115&CFTOKEN=97076474
I am a woman who recently experienced my first hemorrhoids. They were painful, revolting and extremely embarrassing. Sitting in the stirrups while my doctor treated them was humiliating enough -- I couldn't bear to ask her this question: how long should I wait before I have anal sex? PAIN IN THE... 

Again with the ass and me calling doctors! The Hassle Free Clinic says you can proceed with anal sex """"when you feel comfortable,"""" but use plenty of lube and take it slow. 

Some invasive surgery in the genital/anal area takes about six weeks to heal completely, but a hemorrhoidectomy, according to Heidi at Dr. Stubbs' office, may take only a week, depending on the severity of your condition and whether the procedure is done at a hospital or clinic. Looks like you'll be riding that red-eye flight again in no time. 
Pick up a copy of the book Anal Pleasure and Health, by Jack Morin.

The brain does not readily accept the changes the drug causes, so it takes time before it helps.  I do not recall if Prozac is an SSRI or MAOI or SDRI, but basically the excess f neurotransmitter this leaves in the brain desensitizes the brain to the neurotransmitter, and that takes a few weeks.

3002034,I have been diagnosed with an arachnoid cyst on the right parieto-occipital region. Where is that exactly?,"So I had my MRI yesterday and that's what the results came back as.  Doc said that the cyst is on the right parieto-occipital region, which, of course, means nothing to me.  It's measurements are 3.5 x 2.1 x 2.9 cm in diameter.  So anyone who has had any experience along these lines and can help shed some light, I'd be more than appreciative!  They are in the process of setting up my appointment with the neurosurgeon sometime this week or next.  Thanks in advance for any help you can give!","Hopefully I'll be able to make this diagnosis--which obviously wasn't explained very well by your doctor--a little clearer.  The right parieto-occipital region of the brain is towards the back of the head, since that's where the occipital lobes are.  This cyst is also somewhat lateral--towards the side--since there is also mention of the parietal lobe, which is directly in front of the occipital lobe.

An arachnoid cyst is a cyst of the middle membrane that surrounds the brain, which is called the arachnoid. It is one of three membranes of this type. The only treatment, as you probably already know, is surgery to remove it. Anything that grows inside your head that's not supposed to be there can cause increases in the pressure inside the brain, which is absolutely detrimental, so even if it's benign--which an arachnoid cyst IS--they want to remove it ASAP.

The parents fault, the schools, or....both?","I agree.  Also, have you seen the lunch menu the schools serve the kids?  It is ridiculous.  Many parents, because they work, think it is ok to serve their kids quick, easy and unhealthy meals.  It is a shame.  What is even more of a shame is stores are cashing in on fat kids.  I go to look for children's clothes and they actually have plus sizes for kids!  I have a hard time finding """"slims"""" for my kids.

AUTISM, AUTISTIC, ADHD, ADD, Coma Brain Damage, Special Autistic Kids Treatment Cure By our Master Tole .
 

These Autism , Epilepsy, coma, brain damage etc has been on our research and treatment top list from 1984 .

Each Autistic kids are not the same, different in a few or more conditions and also recovery condition , also lever and rate of recovery.  



(8)Autistic Kids.
1. Autistic Kids Disorder 
Autistic Kids symptoms:

(A) total of six (or more) items from (1), (2), and (3), 
with at least two from (1),
and one each from (2) and (3): 


1. Autism Autistic Kids qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following:

(a) autism encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus 
(b) autism apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals 
(c) stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements or with an object)

All these are the symptom of autism and we have the treatment for all these problem. You have to spend enough time for the intensive treatment in order to get good result, it varies from 1 month to 6 months or more for intensive treatment (remedies, remedy).
Some of the Autistic kids that is difficult to get near to 100 % cure is that they started late on themselves more then 11 years old for some, and others are too stubborn, but we still gets major improvement about 80-90% or so until they can get easy living in their life.
We have long distance friends that",I think that this like many other things that have come and gone in the past years is unfortunatly not a cure.  People are always claiming that a diet or something is going to cure autism.  I work with children with autism and I've never heard about this working.  I know 5 years ago when they thought vaccines may be causing autism it was all over the news.  I think if it did it would be on the news and all over the place - because a cure for autism would be a big deal.  This may be a good treatment for some children but I don't think cure is the right word.

This is exactly the sort of stuff your ob-gyn is trained to handle, and will understand your situation.  Having PCS makes your periods a bit screwy as your hormones don't really act quite the way they should.  

Your doctor can evaluate you to find out 1) why you are clotting and to see if anything else is wrong with you (thyroid issues can make things go squirly too).

You are feeling woozy and tired most likely from the blood loss.  Losing a lot of blood can make you dehydrated, and anemic.  So rest, drink water, take a pain killer for the cramps and call your doctor.  

Good luck.  I know how scary this can seem, I have been through it myself, and for me it turned out to be nothing - some water, and a few weeks or iron pills for the anemia and I was fine.

Right now, I am not glaringly overweight, I don't even think that I look chubby. I have a pretty decent amount of muscle, which I would like to keep for the most part. I don't want to be a twig, but I want to have some muscle definition in my stomach. Right now, I don't have a huge pot belly, but it's very... you know what I mean. So, how should I lose the weight?

Any suggestions?","Everyone looks for an easy solution to weight loss. But there really isn't one (as least that is healthy and not hazardous). Stop eating the junk food for two reasons: it will make the weight loss process harder, and because it is terrible for your health. If you get that craving, just have a bite of chocolate, or a small fry. Don't over do. Eventually, you'll get it out of your system and you'll stop craving it. Just eat right. Fruits, veggies, wheat bread - you know what is healthy and what isn't. As for exercise, I would recommend a little of everything. Go for a jog everyday, lift weights, and play sports. Just make sure it is something you enjoy doing, otherwise your weightloss will be a choir - making it an even harder task.

Well I've done some research and it sounds like Gentamycin can cause deafness or kidney problems in unborn fetuses. And Cipro has caused skeletal fusion in fetuses of pregnant rats.

No one in the family is in need of any of her money but she acts like someone is after it.  Anytime she buys something new she makes up big elaborate lies about why she had to buy it, or else some story about how someone just gave her something for free.  She tells everyone she is broke when it is very obvious that she is not.  We can't figure out why she is doing this.  She even makes up stories for normal things like new shoes, or medical things like hearing aids.  What's going on with her?  She does see a doctor for regular check ups, but I don't know if he is aware of this behavior.  Is it something that the family should discuss with him or is it best to stay out of it?  She acts normal other than the lying, which seems to gradually get worse.  Is her money making her paranoid?","Sounds as though she is manifesting some paranoid symptoms, likely as a result of early dementia or some other organic brain disorder.  So long as she is able to conduct her affairs without affecting anyone else (except their irritation at her confabulated rationale), there is no action that needs to be taken.  Confabulation is often a mechanism that shows up when memory fails, and it may not be consciously that she is doing this.

But be on the alert for other signs, such as not paying bills/getting utilities cut off.

2964508,"why is my 3.5 year old giving me so problems with eating lately, and why the sudden temper tantrums?","she has recently been giving me a really hard time when it comes to eating. normally, she eats A LOT! it used to blow me away at the amount of food she could consume in a day, now i'm lucky if i get 1 meal a day in her. i know kids will eat when they are hungry, but it seems that she just isn't hungry. this has been an issue for the last 2 weeks. also, she has NEVER thrown a tantrum, until last night. she threw such a fit, and got so upset, and screamed so much, that she made herself cough until she threw up...3 times! what's the deal here?","Wow. The first thing I would check is her interaction with people over the past couple weeks. Is she in Daycare? Does she have a play pal she's spending a lot of time with? Does she have a caregiver at home if you work outside the home?

Sometimes kids at that age have observed another person behaving in a particular way in order to obtain the desired result 
(ie. a tantrum that gets a child an ice cream or toy they want). She might be trying out this new negotiation technique.

Another thing about 3 1/2, they are learning a zillion new things each day and their little heads are full, full, full. Imagine if you worked in an office and you had 20 projects you needed to complete and your boss came in and dumped a huge stack of stuff in your inbox and said, """" I need this ASAP"""". You might grumble after the boss leaves, but a three year old faced with a proportionally simliar moment will fling themselevs onto the floor and scream and cry until all the bad stuff goes away.

Try simplifying her schedule for a couple of days and try going on a food field trip to the grocery store. Take your time and show her all the pretty produce and things she might like and get a cheap little notebook to carry around to write down the list of all the things she likes. Then when you do your shopping, you can get a few things off her favorite list each time so she has some say in what goes into her tummy. You could go through magazines and cut out pictures of food or use the google image option and make her a """"Menu"""" like she's got her own restaurant. You can split it up in pages of breakfast, lunch and dinner and special snacks. She can go through the picture book and select what she will eat and then you can show her how to spell that word and maybe how to make the food item (like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich)

Both of my kids went through the ridiculously picky eater stage about that age. They will survive! My son is 6'2"""" and a college rower and my daughter is 5'10"""" and a volleyball player and coach.  The month my son would only eat cubes of baked potatoes, Stouffer's spinach souffle, pizza, Cheerios, PBJ's and hot dogs I thought I was gonna lose it! She will move through it.

Temper tantrum solution: This is weird but IT WORKS. When kids are out of control, it scares them as much as it scares you.
Get an ice cold cup of water and very calmly tell her to take a sip and calm down. If she won;t, tell her she can drink it or wear it. If she continues to flail and scream ( and I know this sounds bizzare) toss the water right in her face. She will come to a complete stop and you will have her full attention.

Go and get another cup of ice cold water and ask her if she is now ready to have a sip of water. She will drink it- trust me. And the cold and sipping motion will calm her down enough to regain control of her self.

I only had to do this ONE TIME with my kids. Any time I saw a tantrum coming from then on, I would ask them if they needed a glass of water and they would calm down and even go get themselves a cup.

Those people need to get more educated about auto-immune diseases.

No, pills don't aways """"cure"""" people and then they drop weight. The more calories resricted for someone with hypothyroidism, the MORE wt. they gain. This has been found over and over again.

He was crying, screaming all the time and had painful gas and constipation.  The dr put him on a trial of soy, but he had the same symptoms.

It usually happens because the facial nerve which supplies the muscles in the face gets a bit swollen, sometimes after a common type of viral infection, and because it passes througha bony canal, it gets squashed. 

The fact that it has happened a second time on the other side is suggestive that there is some underlying cause. The 2 possibilities are that either there is a specific cause for both nerves to be affected - this situation would be called ""Mononeuritis Multiplex"", of which there are many causes eg different types of inflammation or infection, or the other possibility is the nerves have been affected by some process involving the covering of the brain (the meninges) which covers the nerves as they come out of the brain.

It is not possible that this is a stroke and highly unlikely to lead to one. However it is important to get to the bottom of this. A CT scan will be of little help. An MRI scan is probably needed, along with a variety of blood tests.

1080718,Disc De Compression?,"Can anyone talk to me about the effectiveness of disc decompression? I had it four months ago on December 20th, the post op pain was treated with morphine for ten days, I came home on day 12, and remained immobile in agony for further three months. My problem was prolapsed discs L4 S1 trapped sciatic nerve, 5 years agony, after two MRI's they decided on surgery. I had to go back in for spinal epidural nerve root block because the surgery made it worse. Anyone experienced this? I have made a little progress re: pain, about 50% better, not good enough. As soon as I try to do the normal things I did before the problem & pain, such as drive a little, walk a little, sit a while in a theatre, hoover a little, the pain comes back and knocks me over.  I need to get back to work, having earned zilch since December 14th. Best answer so far came from Amy, thanks Amy!Shall follow her advice, as she had her op quite near my hometown. All I read it bad news, wish I'd never had it done now. Thanks!","Courtyard worker.  I see folks like you in my office frequently.  Your story is so common there is a syndrome named after it- failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS).  Unfortunately you are probably going to have these problems to some degree or another for the rest of your life.  Far too often people jump right into drugs and surgery and fail to explore the other options that are far less invasive and, frankly more effective (70% of back surgeries fail).  There are literally hundreds of options and you have already mentioned one, decompression.  If you had a spinal fusion, which it sounds like you did, it's too late for that.  They bridged the spinal joints with bone and now there is to joint to decompress.  The best option you have now is chiropractic (it was your best option five years ago too, but it's a little late for that now).  If you had L4-S1 fused, the problem you are facing now is that L3 is having to do a ton of work... a lot more work than it was designed to do.  Chiropractic can help to make sure that L3 stays healthy and isn't the next to go.  Your Doctor (chiropractic not medical) should also ensure that your pelvis is free of distortion.  This will help.

I get life having challenges but I don't get when the suffering and pain never ends.  I've been put on a set of different meds, the last one a new 'MAOI"""" plus Lamictle and Ativan; SSRI's don't work on me.  The anxiety comes/goes, but the depression sucks.  I hope the new meds work.

I have also tried cognative therapy, medation, food changes and """"people editing"""" (err, diss the ones in your life that do not work), prayer, changing things, etc.

I just can't seem to get to a comfortable spot in my life, not one minute. I have no family, all died, and most of my friends here are moving away.  Any hopefull suggestions?","It sounds like you are not thinking about solving one problem at a time, but focussing on them all at once, which can be stressful, overwhelming, and can worsen your depression. Here are some things you can try at home to decrease your depression. Hope this helps.

""""GET OUT OF BED: 

One of the most important things you can do is get up at about the same time every morning (even week-ends). Preferably, that means about 7 a.m. or earlier. You might not feel like it but Get Up. Such regularity helps your body function more normally so you're more likely to feel normal. 

LIGHTS: 

Light helps your body function better. So turn on a lot of lights as soon as you arise. Open curtains to get more sunlight. Better yet, go outdoors into the sunshine as soon as you can. Remove any eyewear so light will enter more readily (glass cuts out some of the sun's rays). But don't stare at the sun, of course. 

MOVE: 

Be active right away -- oxygenate! That means getting up and walking around your dwelling for five or 10 minutes, or perhaps riding an exercycle. Mild exercise gets the blood flowing and transports more oxygen throughout your body (especially to your brain), helping you feel mentally alert and alive. 

MUSIC: 

Select and play some energetic, happy music as you dress and have your breakfast. The audiovisual department of most libraries has albums and tapes you can check out. 
  

BREAKFAST: 

Begin your breakfast with protein (i.e., meat, eggs, peanut butter, nuts, cheese). When you get up, your body chemistry is ready to convert food, especially protein,into longlasting energy. To balance your most important meal of the day, add an orange or other fresh fruit and whole grain cereal or whole grain bread. 

TALK WITH SOMEONE: 

One of the quickest ways to beat the blues is to interact with others. You might not feel like doing that - you'd rather avoid people when blue. So make lt easier on yourself. Talk with someone you enjoy about a subject you enjoy so there is definite give and take. 

And, force yourself to say """"hello"""" to the persons next to you in class, those where you live, anyone around. 

LIMIT CAFFEINE: 

The long-term (four hours or so) effects of caffeine are depression. Try to limit coffee to no more than one cup in the morning. Coffee can make you more alert for an hour or so, but later you get an opposite reaction. Caffeine tends to increase the release of insulin in the blood, and insulin lowers the blood sugar level. When you have low blood sugar levels, you begin to feel less sure of yourself, and have low energy levels, which can lead to the blues or depression. 

LIMIT SUGAR: 

Sugar might give you an initial rush of energy, but within an hour or so the blood sugar level can become low, and when it's low you may feel low, too. 

The caffeine/sugar cycle. It's easy to get caught in the caffeine and sugar cycle -- having coffee, caffeinated soft drinks, or something with sugar every two hours or so to """"stay up."""" For example, cola contains about 10 teaspoons of sugar plus caffeine equal to about half a cup of coffee. In addition to bringing on the blues, this cycle can result in dependence, poor nutrition. and obesity -- reasons to get down on yourself even more and feel blue. 

MAINTAIN FIBER: 

Fiber helps food go through your digestive system at a proper rate, giving a more constant energy supply. Highly processed foods merely provide a quick surge of energy which can be followed by depression. You can maintain fiber in your diet by eating an orange or grapefruit rather than just drinking the juice. Eat fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and whole grain breads and cereals. 

STRESS B COMPLEX: 

Some persons report receiving help by taking a concentrated vitamin B complex. You'll find these called something like """"Stress B"""" or """"B 50."""" This is controversial. 
Some nutritionists say, """"Yes, this",Anxiety Panic Disorder/Depression i,,,NA,"The anxiety comes/goes, but the depression sucks.

1482978,"HPV, getting pregnant and chance of miscarrages?","I have HPV and have had two coloposcopies with another one scheduled for the 28th. I have also had the LEEP procedure done once. I know the HPV never goes away, but I was wondering if anyone who has had LEEP or other HPV/abnormal Pap/mild dysplasia treatments done who have had problems either conceiving or carrying a baby to term? Does it hinder conception or does it cause early miscarriages? Can it still be treated during pregnancy?","HPV is unlikely to affect your pregnancy or your baby's health. If you have genital warts, they may grow faster during pregnancy, possibly from the extra vaginal discharge that provides the virus with a moist growing environment, hormonal changes, or changes in your immune system. In most cases they won't pose any problems for you or your baby.

It's possible for you to pass the virus to your baby, but this doesn't happen very often. Even if your child does contract HPV, he's likely to overcome it on his own without any symptoms or problems. In the unlikely event that he gets the type of HPV that causes genital warts, he may develop warts on his vocal cords and other areas sometime in infancy or childhood. This condition, called recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, is very serious, but fortunately it's also rare. 

There's no drug that can get rid of the virus. If you have warts, your practitioner may decide not to treat them during your pregnancy, because they often get better on their own or even disappear altogether after you give birth.There are various treatments, however, that can be used to remove the warts safely during pregnancy.

If your practitioner decides removal is necessary, she may use a special acid solution, freeze them off with a liquid nitrogen solution, or remove them by laser, by electrocautery, or surgically. (Two prescription products that women apply themselves are used to treat genital warts, but they're generally not recommended during pregnancy. And don't ever try to treat genital warts with drugstore medications meant for common warts.)

If your Pap smear is abnormal, your practitioner may examine your cervix and vagina with a special microscope in a procedure called colposcopy. (A colposcopy is no more uncomfortable than a Pap, though it takes longer.) If she sees suspicious changes in your cells, she may take a biopsy of the tissue, which can cause some temporary discomfort and bleeding.

If there's no evidence of invasive cancer, your practitioner will most likely wait until after you give birth to further treat the abnormal cells, although depending on your situation, the colposcopy might need to be repeated during your pregnancy. Your practitioner will follow up with another colposcopy about six to eight weeks after you give birth to see if the problem persists. In many cases, the abnormal changes go away on their own after delivery, making further interventions unnecessary.",HPV and have had two coloposcopies,,Female,NA,,,,,Does it hinder conception or does it cause early miscarriages,LEEP procedure done once,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,,,,Yes: Does it hinder conception or does it cause early miscarriages?

3168531,does my 2 year old have diabetes?,"Hi my daughter is 2 1/2 years old, recently she has been drinking excessively and constantly waking up soaking wet several times in the night.
I am frequently changing her nappy when we are out and when we are at home i am emptying her potty every 10 minutes this has only recently occured and even during the height of the summer when she would be expected to drink more her fluid intake was the same as normal.
basically what im asking is does any one out there have diabetic children and do they think this is linked i read that blurred vision is another symptom and she has just got her first pair of glasses.
If some one could give me some advice before i take her to the doctors i would be very grateful.
thanks","There are two types of diabetes.  The first, Type I, used to be refered to as juvenile diabetes because it was detected in childhood.  It is caused when the cells in the Isle of Langerhans in the spleen quit producing insulin or die.  It requires injections of insulin to treat.
  The other, Type II, is usually associated with late adulthood.  The person still produces insulin, usually in normal amounts, but due to a metabolic/edocrine malfunction, the body is unable to use the insulin as efficiently as it should.  A variation of this type is known as Gestational Diabetes, and develops only during pregnancy and disappears with delivery.  It is an indicator of risk to develop Type II later in life, but not a guarentee.
  It is rare to diagnose Type II diabetes in a child so young, but not so rare to diagnose Type !.  Although she does seem to urinate and drink a great deal, that in itself can have plenty of other explainations.   Juvenile diabetes is not a condition that develops slowly, and there is most usually a crisis point when the sugar levels in the blood reach dangerous levels.  That leads to a hospital/ER visit, and the diagnosis.  Your daughter is not likely truly diabetic, although there is something going on that the pediatrician needs to check out.  There are too many other potential problems to consider with the limited amount of information that you could disclose on the web, and of course testing ability is nil.
  The vision difficulties could be related, or could be simply due to genetics.  The doctor, unfortunately is the only one who can do that sort of determination.  Small children represent a practice of medicine completely different from that of adults, or even older children.  The rules that apply to the rest of us simply don't apply to small ones as young as your daughter.
  The doctor should be able to eliminate your diabetes concerns quite easily with a blood sugar test, and possibly a glucose tolerance test.  That is a bit difficult to do with one so small, as the glucose solution invariably makes them ill.  But that would be the logical first step.  I imagine the first test he will do is the simple blood sugar test, and a urine test to detect sugar in the urine.   From there it is hard to say what he/she will look into, as that would depend on his exam and her medical history- and the family history as well.
  I really don't think you have to be concerned about the juvenile diabetes.  While it is not unknown in one so young, that is usually associated with a very strong family history of the disorder.  It is also associated with viral infections, usually a very severe infection accompanied by high fever.   Most juvenile diabetics are closer to 9 or 10 at onset.  It also doesn't tend to develop over months, but rather days.
  As one mother to another, I wish I could tell you there was nothing to be concerned about, but truthfully I can't even completely eliminate the possibility that you are correct.

418952,I want to know what risk I have of HIV from fingering a girl with possibly a cut on my finger.?,"A couple months ago I met this girl. We made out a few times and got pretty serious although we never had sex. 

I did finger her downstairs a few times with full penetration with my fingers. I often get small cuts on my fingers from my work.

Now, I stupidly asked her -after- a few times about her STDs and AIDS/HIV thing.  However, she seemed to withdraw at that point, and never said explicitly that she didnt have it, just that if I was worried get a test. She just wouldnt say she definately didnt have it.  It kind of went downhill from there and I haven't seen her in a while.

Now two months later, I feel sick. it's been that way for a month, nothing debilitating, I worry I did catch HIV and I've got seroconversion illness. Ive got a cough, diarrhea and I have general malaise.  I previously in the month had a fever and a very mild rash over my upper body.

could be an arrhythmia, triggered by the vagus which is highly active during feeding.

could be on-going heart attack, how sure is everyone that the blockage was opened, and is still open?

could be aortic disease that was worsened by the angioplasty (the ballon goes from leg through the aorta, to the heart).  The abdominal aorta supplies blood to the gut, and if this blood is blocked, people get very anxious eating, get food fear, weight loss....

All the blood tests are coming back normal as well as the MRI.  The only thing he tested positive for was the rheumatoid factor (and slightly anemic) but he doesn't have rheumatoid arthritis per 2 doctors.  He's starting to lose his balance when he stands/walks and can't sit down for any amount of time without pain from the hips down to the ankles (including the muscles).  The only comfortable position he can be in with the least amount of pain is flat on the floor - even sleeping on an extremely comfortable mattress hurts.  Regardless of where he sleeps at night, he is woken up in the middle of the night with pain.  He is taking naprosyn per the UCLA doctor until he can get in to see her.  Has anyone else experienced this or know anything about this?  He was negative for lupus, mono, lyme disease, ankylosing spondylitis.","Is it possible he's suffering from a form of dysplasia or fibromyalgia?

Edit: ah yes, the treatment. Well, when I went to the doc's he prescribed some anti-inflammatory (prescription strength since it's the best thing to take). He also told me to ice the chest down when ever possible. 

In order to get the right meds if you need them, a doc has to write a prescription for you, and thus he needs to see you.

I have no other kids but I am a sort of step mother to my boyfriend's 7 year old. I am happy with my life but ever since this has happened I have been dealing with feelings of loss secretly. I lost my mom in Dec 2003, and this has also brought back sadness of that as well. I just wish I could snap back out of this funk and go on with living.",Although I don't have the answer you want ... I can relate with your feelings. I don't know if just knowing that you are not alone in this helps or not. I went through almost the same exact situation about 6 months ago and it brought back all kinds of feelings of lose and sadness. I am sorry that you are having these feelings and hope you can learn to cope in some way. I still just push all of my hurt to the back of my mind...some days I am kinda ok and other days I cry at the drop of a hat--I guess its just something you have to carry with you for the rest of your life.

620863,Does anyone know anything about LCPD or Legg Calve  Perthes Disease?,"We were told my 3 year old grandson has it almost a year ago and that his bone to his hip is completely dead and all we could do was watch him and do x-rays to watch for changes. 2 weeks ago after the x-rays he told us to cut his activities back and give him Motrin 2 to 3 times a day. No jumping, climbing,kicking, sliding or any kind of playground activities.This will be for years. He said this is the beginning of the critical time for him. I know this disease is rare and I just wonder if there are many people out there with kids this young and how do you deal with with slowing them down. We have adopted him and he is a little 100% boy always climbing and running and it is so hard to get him to slow down. He does not understand that it will hurt him. If anyone knows anything about this disease I would like to hear from you. Thank  You..","Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease (aseptic or avascular necrosis of the femoral head)

Avascular necrosis occurs when the bone that makes up the ball portion of the hip is damaged from lack of blood supply. The reasons this occurs are not clear. Since a higher incidence of this disorder is noted in several dog breeds, including terrier breeds, miniature pinscher, poodles and possibly schipperkes, it is assumed that there may be a genetic component to the problem. In Manchester terriers, the genetic component appears to be a strong influence and heritability is pretty high for this problem.

Most of the time the clinical signs of this disease occur in 4 to 11 month old dogs and usually consist of lameness of one leg only. Pain may be mild to very severe. Some dogs have mild forms of this condition and do not require medical care. In other dogs, the condition cause sufficient pain and deformity of the hip joint to require surgical intervention. The disorder can usually be confirmed with X-rays. Atrophy of the muscles of the affected leg is not uncommon. If this is severe it can slow the recovery period considerably and may make medical therapy less likely to work.

Treatment of this condition varies according to the severity of the signs seen. In mild cases, enforced rest may be sufficient to allow healing of the damaged areas to occur. In some cases, immobilization of the affected limb using an Ehmer sling may be beneficial to recovery. Many dogs have advanced cases of this disease by the time they are examined by a veterinarian and medical treatment is not likely to work. In these dogs, excision of the femoral head (ball portion of the hip joint) is often beneficial. Removal of this section of the bone diminishes painful bony contact in the hip joint. Recovery from this surgery can be slow with recovery periods of up to one year sometimes occurring before good use of the affected leg returns. If muscle atrophy is not present at the time of surgery the recovery time is usually much less. Pain relief and anti-inflammatory medications may be beneficial.

There is a stronger tendency to treat this as a medical condition prior to surgery right now. A general rule of thumb is to allow non-surgical therapy a month to show a beneficial response. If one is not seen, surgical repair should be considered more carefully.",LCPD or Legg Calve  Perthes Disease,,,NA,,,,,He said this is the beginning of the critical time for him.,LCPD or Legg Calve  Perthes Disease,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,I just wonder if there are many people out there with kids this young and how do you deal with with slowing them down.

2092774,Does anyone have experiece/know of treatment options for chiari?,"Hello, I was wondering if anyone has had experience with chiari and knew of any treatments. My boyfriend (he is 20) has just been diagnosed with the disease (has off-and-on, mild to severe headaches) and friends and family are trying to find out as much as possible. 

He has seen a neurosurgeon, but he said the only option was surgery, with a bovine skull replacement, or just deal w/ the headaches (unless neurological signs begin). It seemed like a pretty hollistic view. His mom has already found out the bovine skull is not necessary for the surgury.

He is going in for a second opinion in LA and have a MRI of the spine as well. I was just wondering if anyone else had experience with this and knew of other ways to treat it? Some of the info is vague, I'm not sure if it is type 1 or 2, and the cyst is about 4 cm large right now :/ Thanks so much in advance, and any help is greatly appreciated!","Treatment Options for Chiari Malformation
Neurologists and neurosurgeons at Mayo Clinic take a conservative approach to treating Chiari malformation to spare patients unnecessary surgery that will not alleviate their symptoms. While many people may have a subtle Chiari malformation that is evident on an MRI, few malformations are serious enough to warrant treatment.

The goal of treatment is to halt or reverse the progression of signs and symptoms. This may be accomplished by surgery to relieve the pressure on the brain stem, cerebellum and spinal cord, and to re-establish spinal fluid circulation.

The surgical procedure (posterior fossa craniectomy or posterior fossa decompression), involves removing a small section of bone at the back of the head to relieve pressure by making more room for the cerebellum. The covering of the brain (dura) may also be enlarged with a patch created from synthetic material or tissue from the patient's leg muscle. This helps make more room for the brain and the spinal cord and helps to establish the flow of cerebral spinal fluid. The operation generally takes two to three hours. Recovery time in the hospital could take from two to four days.

A cervical laminectomy is also performed. This involves the removal of the bone forming the back of the vertebra or lamina. Both the posterior fossa decompression and the cervical laminectomy are done at the same time, through the same surgical incision in the back of the head and upper neck.

Occasionally, the surgery may be modified if there is a syrinx (fluid-filled cavity in the spinal cord) present or if the patient has hydrocephalus. Most patients who have the surgery do quite well and their symptoms improve.

Surgery performed on patients who can truly benefit from the operation often successfully relieves the symptoms of Chiari malformation.",treatment options for chiari,,Female,NA,,,,,"My boyfriend (he is 20) has just been diagnosed with the disease (has off-and-on, mild to severe headaches) and friends and family are trying to find out as much as possible.",chiari,,,,,,,NA,NA,He is going in for a second opinion in LA and have a MRI of the spine as well.,a second opinion in LA and have a MRI,"Some of the info is vague, I'm not sure if it is type 1 or 2, and the cyst is about 4 cm large right now",chiari,"He has seen a neurosurgeon, but he said the only option was surgery, with a bovine skull replacement, or just deal w/ the headaches (unless neurological signs begin).

I had to reply to you straight away, as I am 25 too, and two years ago had my 1st mild dyskaryosis smear result. I went back 6 months later. (It can clear up by the way, which is why they call you back in 6 months.) Mine did not. The 2nd smear also showed mild dyskaryosis. HPV was not tested for at this smear. I then had a colposcopy, which is not that bad. I went back again and was told that the biopsy showed moderate to severe dyskaryosis with HPV, so it was worse than I thought. Everyone's treatment varies. I was very lucky, as although the grading of mine usually calls for the loop excision, I was offered cryotherapy as the area affected was so small.

Apparently, once treated, problems rarely reoccur, but obviously, they keep a check on you. After my treatment, I went back 6 months later, then six months after that for smears. Both were clear and I now have to go every year for the next nine years to make sure.

I must say to you though, I HATE going for smears. I used to faint every time. Nearly fainted after the colposcopy too. So I was petrified. Now, I look back and think I was lucky compared to many, and we are lucky to have such a system in our country where they do check these things.

These would be the tests required to find out the root cause of your problem. Till then anything is just speculation:

-Blood tests such as CBC, electrolytes, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B-12 levels
-Imaging studies like a CT scan of the head, CT scan of the spine, MRI of the head, or MRI of the spine
-Electromyography to measure how your muscles respond to nerve stimulation
-X-ray of the affected area
-Lumbar puncture to assess for multiple sclerosis and other conditions
-Ultrasound of neck vessels to evaluate your risk for TIA or stroke

3608063,How do I get rid of the itching of Neurodermatitis?. Is this disease curable?,"I have a persistent itch on my face. The diagnosis from a lab-test is neurodermatitis. My research through Google tells me that it is not curable. How do I stop the itching? Is there anyone with this problem who can give me some help? I have suffered for the past 8 months and I am frustrated. Doctors prescribe lotions and the 5 different prescriptions do not help. Anyone who can provide me with information that might be helpful would have my sincerest gratitude. 

Thank you.","Moisturizers- Moisturizers or emollients including bath oils, soap substitutes can be applied to the dermatitis as frequently as required to relieve itching, scaling and dryness. Emollients should also be used on the unaffected skin to reduce dryness. Emollient therapy helps to restore one of the skin's most important functions, which is to form a barrier to prevent bacteria and viruses getting into the body and therefore help to prevent a rash becoming infected. Emollients are safe and rarely cause an allergic reaction. Occasionally, products with lanolin may cause a reaction. Ideally, moisturizers should be applied three to four times a day. Apply in a gentle downward motion in the direction of hair growth to prevent accumulation of cream around the hair follicle (this can cause infection of the follicle).

Coal Tar- Coal tar has been used to treat the itching and inflammation caused by skin conditions for hundreds of years. The tar contains chemicals that soothe the skin. Crude coal tar is a byproduct of oil production. It makes the skin more sensitive to light. In its natural state it is a thick, brownish-black substance that is messy to apply to the skin. Refined coal tar preparations, many of which are available over the counter, may be more cosmetically acceptable. Coal tar has been used for many years to treat psoriasis and it has few side effects. However, it does not work for everyone. In addition to being messy to use, it has a strong odor and can stain skin and clothing. It can cause sun sensitivity, and may irritate acute dermatitis. Tar creams or bath emulsions can be helpful for mild inflammation of atopic dermatitis. The smell may be offensive to some people.

Corticosteroids / Topical steroids ï¿½ Topical steroid medications are one of the most common treatments for mild to moderate psoriasis. They reduce redness (inflammation) and itching and stop the rapid build-up of dead skin cells. They come in varying strengths, from weak to highly potent. They are available as creams, gels, lotions, ointments, or solutions. A steroid mousse is now available to treat scalp psoriasis. Topical steroids can become less effective if used repeatedly for a long time. This is called resistance. The best outcome may be achieved when topical steroids are combined with other medications applied to the skin. Steroids in the form of pills or injections are generally not used to treat psoriasis because they have too many serious side effects. Also, psoriasis can come back worse than ever when treatment stops. Long-term use of potent topical steroids on large areas of skin can produce side effects such as stretch marks, thinning and reddening of the skin, and the appearance of small blood vessels through the skin. These medications should not be put on the face or on areas of the body where the skin folds, such as the armpits, groin, and webs of the toes. Use of steroid ointments and creams requires good judgment and careful supervision. They come in various strengths from mild to super-potent. Ask the doctor about potency and side effects of prescribed corticosteroid medicines. Corticosteroid medicines are prescribed for atopic dermatitis to calm the inflamed skin. Avoid combination topical steroid/antifungal cream in the treatment of diaper rash.

Topical Immunomodulators- Topical immunomodulators (TIMs) are a new type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of eczema. Mild burning sensations have been reported when applying TIMs. In general, however, TIMs have fewer side effects than corticosteroids. TIMs are topical drugs that modulate the immune response (alter the reactivity of cell-surface immunologic responsiveness). Studies have shown that this class of drugs will improve or completely clear eczema in more than 80 percent of treated patients, with a side-effect profile comparable with topical steroids.

My guess is the numbness is caused by pressure (impingement) on a nerve.

If you're still active duty, avoid the blame game on your doctor...they'll all be afraid to help you.

Start with sick call and complain about the numness.
You'll get a profile and a weeks supply of Ibuprofen.
After the profile expires, complain again...you may get lucky with an x-ray referal.
The x-rays will turn out non-conclusive and you'll get another profile and more Ibuprofen.
At that point you can ask for an MRI...if they deny you; ask to see a civilian doctor.

If you can't get a referal for a civilian doctor...go to a civilian med station at the mall on a Sunday. Tell the civilian doc every last detail. Hopefully, you'll get that MRI and they can see what went wrong or what is wrong.

The Sciatic nerve guess is a good one...but the numbness from an impinged sciatic nerve will continue up your foot and into your leg.

whatever it was,  3 high readings on 3 separate occasions must be there before a diagnosis of hypertension is considered.

believe me, if your pulse is 54 at rest you are very healthy and you dont need any lifestyle modifications. my only advice would be to continue the same and stay away from smoking , alcohol, and drugs.

at such a young age the usual explanation for high blood pressure is secondary , meaning that there is an underlying disease. in that case lifestyle changes are not useful because the underlying condition must be treated.
lifestyle changes are useful for the hypertension that usually comes with middle age .

(white coat hypertension)

its a false rise in blood pressure due to anxiety or fear, its the most common cause of misdiagnosis of hypertension.

ps
i dont know of a relation between bp and psoriasis.
like i said you should get 2 more measurements,and if it is still high, then you will have to think about possible underlying causes,like

kidney vascular abnormality
chronic kidney disease(pyelonephritis)
endocrine problems(pheochromocytoma,thyrotoxicosis)

225993,Link between immunity and moles/freckles?,"Ever since I've had a weak immune system (started off with glandular fever 5 yrs ago, then problems with chronic fatigue/post viral syndrome since, plus I have Candidiasis - all of which Im trying to treat) my skin has been prone to freckles and moles. I don't go out in the sun often (and I usually wear sunscreen) but Ive developed heaps of moles over the last 5 years. Before I had health problems I never had any moles, and spent more time in the sun than I do now.

A few people have told me I get them so easily due to having a weakened immune system. Can anyone confirm/give any further information about this suggestion?","It could theoretically be that your weakened immune system is not able to control cancerous growths like it used to.  Under normal circumstances, the immune system patrols the body, looking for cells that are growing out of control, and keeping them in check (usually by killing them completely but sometimes just by controling their growth).  If you are immunosupressed, your immune system can't patrol for these uncontrolled growths as well as it used to.  Moles are a type of uncontrolled cell growth that is usually kept in check by the immune system.  It could be that your immune system is no longer able to stop the growth of these moles and that is why they are suddenly growing.  The best thing you could do is talk to your doctor about them and, even more importantly, keep an eye on them.  Note their number, size, shape, and color, and if anything changes, definitely contact a doctor.  Your immune system plays a very important role in keeping cancer in check, so it's best to keep an eye on it yourself if your immune system can't.

Please note I AM NOT saying you have cancer!  Don't freak out or anything.  Just keep an eye on things and know what to expect.",immunity and moles/freckles,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Before I had health problems I never had any moles, and spent more time in the sun than I do now.",immunity and moles/freckles,NA,NA,,Can anyone confirm/give any further information about this suggestion?,,A few people have told me I get them so easily due to having a weakened immune system.,,,Yes: I AM NOT saying you have cancer!

1573821,Can a stroke affect only one personality in someone with multiple personalities?,"This is strictly conjecture on my part. My recently deceased mother had a serious stroke. The day I brought her home from the hospital, I was in the kitchen and heard a young girl's voice coming from her room. A perfect, clearly ennuciated sentence, though I couldn't tell what she said. I don't know if my mom had MPD but I'd always suspected it. A psychiatrist said that it would have been impossible, if she did have that condition, to speak clearly considering the expressive aphasia. Again, this is all conjecture on my part. My mother was an excellent woman but changed behaviors so quickly.
Any thoughts from a neurologist or anyone in the medical field?","I am not in the medical field, but I myself have multiple personalities and have found that whatever bodily disease I have usually effects the others. What may have happened with your mother is that she attempted to speak and get your attention, but it came out differently then her own voice because of the stroke. There isn't any way for most people to know if they have a multiple personality because alot of people are able to incorperate them into one entity, unless they get extremely upset which may cause them to """"go inside"""" themselves and another """"person"""" will take over to handle whatever situation upset them. I know from experience that as long as I get time to myself and can be myself then I have no trouble with any one personality """"taking over"""".

2500038,What causes a headache in the same spot above an eye?,What could possibly cause this kind of a headache...It's usually in one spot above the right eye. This has been going on for about 9 months now and the headaches come randomly about 3-4 times a week (doesn't seem to be caused because of change in weather). The pain is usually sharp just in that area. Could this be serious or is it just a normal thing to deal with? What can cause this and what can be done to prevent it other then to drink pills?,"Most headaches around the eyes are one of two types - either migraine, or sinus headache; you may be able to determine which one it is likely to be by the following:  

A migraine headache is virtually entirely on one side of the head; it is often accompanied by nausea, and sensitivity to light and/or sound.  Some people experience an """"aura"""" shortly before the migraine begins; it can be visual, auditory, or even olfactory (sense of smell).  A migraine is often helped by being in a cool, dark room, and often disappears after a period of sleep.  The causes of migraines are not fully understood, but there are prescription medications that can help; ibuprofen helps some people, but usually it doesn't do much.  Some people also respond to medications or liquids containing caffeine.

Sinus headaches behave differently. Generally, the pain is on both sides of the face, and often worst near the cheekbones or around the eyes.  Light or sound generally have little if any effect on the headache.  Cool surroundings often make the sufferer feel worse; warm compresses or a heating pad often help.  Sinus headaches generally respond well to ibuprofen or Tylenol, particularly if combined with sudafed/pseudoephedrine (like Tylenol Sinus formula or a similar medication). 

If either one of these sounds familiar, then check with your doctor - particularly if it is a migraine, as the only really effective migraine medications are prescription-only preparations.  Even if none of the above sounds familiar, it sounds to me like it's time to see your doctor.

Just a question. I am a 27-year-old woman and I am wondering if this is normal. Whenever I go to bed or say I am napping whether its a 1 hour nap or I am getting up from a nights sleep I have to hobble out of bed until I get moving more--this has been going on for the last couple of months it almost feels kind of like tendonitis in the ankles, however my calves are so tight when I first get up that they hurt to move as well...I mean I am not 18 but I am not old either is this normal you think or is it just from being stiff from sleeping through the night? cause once i get moving around I can walk just fine and stuff. 

just curious--thanks--Jammiegirl","It's true as you get older things start to break down and not work so well.  Weird, sporadic problems- they are so annoying.

But this case is troublesome.  If they are tight and painful, it may be like the other person said here - achilles tendonitis.  You could have injured it or overworked continuously and unknowingly it into a chronic condition.  Of course, day to day activities, normal activities are going to aggravate it.

You may want to try to supplement with a few things.  Firstly, you need something anti-inflammatory that works.  The only anti-inflammatories on the market that I give credence to are plain 'ole aspirin and New Chapter 'Zyflamend' and 'Mycomend'.  Zyflamend is an incredibly strong and advanced herbal formulation that is winning folks over by it's scientifically proven efficacy.  I'd start with low-dose aspirin, use it 3 days on, 3 off. 

Mycomend takes more the Eastern medicine angle with 'time-honored' Chinese medicine and the use of specific mushrooms like reishi and maitake to reduce inflammation.  That's more of a *suggestion* than a recommendation like the aformentioned zyflamend.  

You may also want to supplement with those other joint-supplements like MSM, glucosamine and chondroitin.  I can't speak from experience about those, but people seem to talk a lot about them.

Personally, I would just take additional calcium/mag/zinc and C so your tendons can repair themselves and get lots of sleep and plenty of water.  Also, it helps to believe that these things you are doing are helping you.  Because if you do, they will!

305868,i don't understand the value of treatment?,"Two years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD due to severe childhood sexual and physical abuse, and borderline personality disorder.  I hadn't tried to get any help before then, and was involuntarily committed because my roommate caught me drawing pictures with my blood (note to self: keep doors locked).  The doctors gave me a bunch of drugs that made me fat (I gained fifty pounds), so i quit them, and went crazy again (I threw blood on someone, but they deserved it).  So I spent another couple of months in the hospital and stayed fat.  Now I'm out, again, and have been off medication for nine months and am losing weight.  Aside from that I hate myself and sometimes I burn myself and sometimes I have panic attacks if I'm in sexual situations I'm doing pretty well.  All the doctors (at least the ones I can afford) want to do is pump me with medications that make sleepy and stupid and lazy.  Is it really such a problem that I'm not in therapy if I'm only a danger to myself?","The value of treatment is to offer you a chance to get a little relief from your emotional stress (it is EXHAUSTING to change moods fast, control anger, maintain relationships with family and friends, hold down a job, etc. when all of these goals conflict.) The world isn't easy for anyone, but it's exponentially harder when you're fighting depression, the desire to cut and maim yourself, uncontrollable compulsions, extreme anxiety and miscellaneous other pressures. You can choose not to continue therapy, but honestly you can live a more balanced life. You might have to change doctors a few times, and will DEFINITELY change medications more than a few times. Bipolar disorder is a chemical imbalance that requires medication to balance. And PTSD can be controlled with therapy. But you have to be willing to work with someone, and be patient. Its a long, hard road. But you have every right to a happier life.

My question was more of a comment on political correctness. Both are rude, and we live in a country were you can say and do whatever you want, as long as it doesn't impede on the rights of others. If you want to smoke, you should be able to smoke, if you want to eat yourself to death, you have that right too. But lets not pretend that one is better then the other. Really, do you think that the number of people who suffer from these """"conditions"""" that cause obesety is all that significant? Instead of making excuses, more people should own up to there faults. I am overweight, I admit it. And, I used to smoke. I am not blaming anyone. It's funny, though. When I told people that I quit smoking, they congratulated me. When I started my diet, They all told me that I wasn't overweight, or not to """"take it too far"""". I am 5'8, 195lbs. Anorexia isn't even an issue. No one even thought of the health risks that attributed my being overweight, but everyone thought of the potential of me starving myself to death.

Heparin is an anticoagulant (blood thinner); it must be used ONLY UNDER THE ORDERS AND SUPERVISION OF A DOCTOR, because it has a lot of side effects which can be very dangerous and even deadly, specially in a woman who has had several miscarriages AND is trying to conceive. It may actually worsen your condition if used improperly, because it will make you more prone to bleed. You should also avoid using aspirin and its derivatives {like ibuprofen[Motrin, Advil], naproxen[Anaprox, Aleve, Naprosyn] and Coumadin[another kind of anticoagulant similar to heparin]}. First of all, you should treat your underlying condition (thrombophilia= a disease that makes you to have an abnormally low platelet count). Platelets are one of the components in blood, which constitute the body's first line of defense in case of bleeding. Once stabilized, you might try to have another baby, but bear in mind that you are a VERY HIGH RISK patient, and another pregnancy could be harmful, to both you AND the baby-to-be. You should also consult an obstetrician that specializes in high-risk pregnancies for a second opinion and/or further advice or treatment in your case.

is this a phimosis??
and..., when do boys usually have their prepuce retracted?
thanks very much..........","Phimosis is a medical condition in which the foreskin of the penis of an uncircumcised male cannot be fully retracted. The word derives from the Greek phimos (_____, """"muzzle""""). The term is confusing because it is used to denote both a physiologic stage of development (i.e., not a disease), and a pathologic condition (i.e., a condition that causes problems for a person). Elasticity and ambiguity of definition are especially common when referring to infants. Conflicting incidence reports and widely varying post-neonatal circumcision rates reflect looseness in the diagnostic criteria 2,3. Phimosis has become a topic of contention in circumcision debates (see 14 and Medical analysis of circumcision).

Phimosis in most but not all infants is physiologic rather than pathologic, whereas phimosis in older children and adults is more often pathologic than physiologic. Some have suggested that physiologic infantile phimosis be referred to as developmental nonretractility of the foreskin to more clearly distinguish this normal stage of development from pathologic forms of phimosis 10.

Your daughter died because she was diagnosed with a certain kind of cancer that spread through her body. It sounds like your son in law is just basically dying of a broken heart. People do that, our minds are a powerful thing. If you tell yourself something long enough it is going to happen. He probably saw no reason to live anymore and his body started to shut down. 

Your daughter did not get the lung cancer from the dogs, it was from the sarcoma cancer that SPREAD to her lungs. Cancer does that. Skin cancer can do that. Any cancer can attack your vital organs. 

Why were the dogs taken away? Perhaps it was because the owners could no longer take care of them?

Let me tell you this..........8 years ago, Little Cat was diagnosed as being diabetic, he was a year old. I am borderline diabetic, my father is diabetic, BUT it isn't because of Little Cat it is because it runs in the family

You've certainly brought your medical concerns to the right place! The Y!A community members are fully aware of and do appreciate the intimate conditions involving your prognosis.
Most recognized doctors in the field of medicine would employ a holistic approach to your ailment. Lisa, please begin your day with a well balanced breakfast to include an ample portion of fruits and grains. After your morning routines are finished, enjoy a brisk walk around the block. If you happen to meet any stray dogs along the way, it would be a good idea to antagonize the creatures in order to add some vigor to your workout.
Now Lisa, the remaining portions of your day should be filled with interesting activities and new studies to keep your mind active and in balance, complimentary to what you have done with the physical side of yourself.
After loitering around at the public library all afternoon with a bunch of smelly hobos, you can appreciate a warm bath and time to be good to yourself. Begin to collect an archive of various music genres that you can resolve one day to enjoy after you get the rest of your chores done.
Lisa, if after following my advice, simply take two aspirin and forget we ever had this little discussion.
Thank you, Lisa. Have a great day!

265481,Chances me getting pregnant?  Are the odds against me?,"First off my husband had a vasectamy for his ex wife but then they divorced and he and I married and we want to try for a child of our own.  He had the surgery a little under 7 years ago, and in another post I saw that a man's body can develope antibodies against his own sperm after years of disconnection.    Is this true and how many years does it take?  Also he had rhumatic fever when he was a child which he says can render one sterile.  He has 2 children, but there's a very high chance that they are not biologically his anyway so that doesn't tell us anything.  So we have that goig agaist us, plus there's my situation.  When my mother had cancer I was her primay care giver.  One of her treatments was a high dosage of radioactive iodine and she was to be quarentined for many weeks.  As the weeks went on people could be with her more and more.  However since I was her primary care giver there's a chance I was exposed too much.  Can this cause fertility problems?","First off...my husband had a vasectomy reversal under similar circumstances.  Six weeks after he had the surgery, I was pregnant with our first daughter.  Our odds were only 5% that we'd get pregnant...that was two kids ago.  So ignore that anti-body bologna.

Secondly, radio-active medication would depend on exposure.  Keep in mind that your mom's situation is a WAS, not CURRENT.  

If I were you, I would go for a free consultation at your local fertility clinic.  The standard IVF procedure can run up towards 20K...so the clinic will be responsive to a free consult, but also realistic with your chances.

When it's all said and done, if your husband had two children with his first wife (let's just assume that at least one of them actual was HIS) you probably will have success with a reversal and resulting pregnancy.  Just reading about your amount of worrying makes me think you're ready.  Once you get pregnant...the worries only pile up...but they're definitely worth the headache and heartache.

Can anyone relate?","A tough question to answer because there is not enough info.  You stated your Grandmother has an enlarged heart and diabetes.  Does she have problems with CHF (Congestive heart failure)?  Is she using diuretics to get rid of fluid?  The use of diuretics can make the body dump sodium.  Also, normal kidneys can usually regulate sodium to keep a normal balance.

There are so many """"What & Why"""" possibilities that her physician is really the only one with the answers. If the problem is caused by medications/treatment etc., adjustments can be made.

Thanks in advance.","I know you asked for Gyno help, but not only is someone on here probably not a Gyno even if they say they are, but Gyno's can be really deceptive at times.

Let me warn you about a couple of things with the pill (and yes, I took lo-Ovral and have since researched the pill a lot).  The biggest thing of concern is that some birth control pills work in a way that could cause early abortion.  As a matter of fact, it is the low dose pills (which most of them are low dose now-a-days) that do cause the early abortion, because instead of preventing ovulation, they tend to stop implantation, so an already fertilized egg (your baby) can not come to you for the nourishment it needs and therefore dies.  Most Dr's don't inform you of this, I didn't know about it until recently (and I haven't been on BC in years) and had I known it I would have NEVER taken it as I am morally opposed to abortion in any form.  Lo-Ovral is a lower dose hormone, it may not work for you.  It didn't for me, I bled through constantly the entire time I was on it, it was horrible.  They upped me to a higher hormone, and it worked for a while, but then I went back to bleeding all the time.  In addition to this, I had the other typical side effects, like weight gain (oh that really sucks, esspecially if you are about to get married) loss of sex drive (you are going to do it for the first time and likely not even enjoy it like you should!) etc...

BC can actually permenantly destory your sex drive.  If I were you (or if I could go back in time and change what I did) DO NOT TAKE THE PILL.  Use a condom, the effectiveness is near the exact same but without all the nasty side effects and possible moral issues.  They have female condoms too.  And, if you are really scared, use spermicide and other things.  None of this in natural, the act of sex is the act of creating a child, so no matter what there is going to be a possibility of pregnancy.  One thing to look into in NATURAL FAMILY PLANNING and tracking your BBT and cervical mucous.  If you are in love with your hubby, I won't stress out too much, even if you did end up pregnant, children are absolute blessings and you will cherish that """"accident"""" for the rest of your life.

Main point: Save your body now while you can, don't cause permanent damage to your sex drive and etc when you have other alternatives.  Trust someone who has been there.

The checklist was not as nice as I will edit it for you, maybe it helps, good luck, honey!

THINGS TO CONTROL OR TAKE AWAY:

A. Sorroundings:

1. Strong lights at night.
2. Too much noise at night
3. TVs turned out late. The blinking lights keeps some children awake.

B. Diet
1. Anything in your daughter s diet that conteins caffeine or other stimulants, for ex. coffee, chocolate, tea, cinammon rollers (anything containing cinammon), give her milk sweetened with natural honey instead.

2. Too much solid food late at night. Keep the solid foods for before 4PM up until 6 PM max.

3. Too much sugar or sweetener in her food. You see, in toddlers sugar is a real booster, it is like jet gasoline in a car, be careful with it. Take away the soft drinks if you give her and substitute it with fruit juices (natural, please!).

4. A lack of salty foods. An desequilibrium of potassium make take away sleep (this is not my mother-s but my doctor-s advice). Give her a lot of vegetables. Tomato is a good one, carrot is another good one.

C.Activities

1. Children have at least 5 times the energy we adults have. It is amazing. She should do a lot of exercise during the day, that means that she is NOT in the age for a lot of mental activity, like watching TV, videos or that kind of stuff but dire hard physical one, she will endure it because THAT is the nature of toddlers. Get her a tricycle, she can wander around the house (you will be scared to know that she will actually do it ALL DAY.

2. She should not sleep at all during the day. Keep her excited.

3. If she has construction type toys, take them away for a while, for ex. building blocks or lego. That needs a lot of concentration that is probably building up stress in her. In other words, she keeps building those blocks during the night. That keeps her awake.

D. Relationships

1. I hope this is not the case, but fights or rows with your husband or partner builds a lot of stress in children. 
If this is the case, then you will have TO STOP it at Once, you are hurting your child. If this is not possible, keep the voices low or do not do it in front of her.

2. I hope this is also NOT the case, but do not be too strict with her, do not beat her, do not harass her, do not be too angry with her. If you live in confining spaces chances are that as a toddler she touches everything, exasperating you. Have patience. Better take her out for a walk to the nearest park. Do not be super protective. Sometimes children have to hurt themselves a little by themselves in order to learn.

3. Any brothers or sisters, or someone else in the family is making her life miserable? Watch out, please!

THINGS TO DO THAT CAN HELP A LOT!

A. Music:

1. Get some REAL relaxing soothing music, New Age will be good, but the ambient kind, for example, David Arkenstone. The music of Native American Indians (with all their pow wows dancing proved to  be Super super effective in making my child to go to sleep, I suppose it was because it resembles the rain somehow, you can get the CDs at 5US$ at amazon. But the best is Classic music, like for ex. Mozart, I can send you some tracks by email if you like. And do not put it loud, for heaven s sake! A low volume works.

B. Stories

Now, be a good mother and read her a story when you send her to bed. She will be bored to hell soon and fast asleep after that. But the thing is, toddlers just love it!

Print out this list and make a mark over the ones you have managed to accomplish. It should work, but if it doesn t, then you need to get her some sedative, like tylenol or nyquil for children and give her a teaspoon before sending her to bed.

Yesterday I was really bad and isolated myself from my fiance and my family.","I agree with not trusting the fact that you were given meds without a diagnostic process of any kind. However, there are a few things that can contribute to mood swings. The most obvious is bipolar disorder (aka manic depression), and there's also menopause (I don't know your age or sex), diet, and just clinical depression which can manifest in many different ways - some people can even have hallucinations with profound depression. 

I suggest that you change doctors and explain all of this to the new doctor. Tell him that you are looking for a doctor that will actually examine and test your symptoms. Let him know what meds you have tried and all the effects they have had. 

You do need to realize that many mental health medications have side effects like the ones you mentioned. You may be able to find one that has fewer effects, but never stop taking a med until you have called your doc and notified him of the problem. These kind of meds need to be kept at an even level in your system, and it can cause more harm than good to take them sporadically or to stop suddenly.

It is a good idea to keep a journal - keep track of your moods - list the feeling, the strength of the feeling, the cause of the feeling (if there is one), the time you began feeling this way, etc. Take this journal with you when you see the doctor.",mood swings,,,,I am extremely depressed right now.,depressed,,,,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,I don't trust her judgement because she prescribed medication without really giving any kind of diagnostic test.,medication,,,,,"I have mood swings throughout the day, and I can actually feel myself going in and out of them?",,,,Yes: I agree with not trusting the fact that you were given meds without a diagnostic process of any kind.

Instead even though your baby is crying, keep her on your breast so that she can keep stimulating your breast and that will tell your body that it needs to make more milk.  Change her from breast to breast if you have to and eventually within a couple days you will produce more milk.  Also drinking lots and lots of water is very important.  You need lots of it to produce milk.  Eating Quacker Oatmeal atleast twice a day also helps.  There are also some teas(Mothers Milk tea, feenugreek and reglan are some) that you can buy at a health store that you can drink too, to increase your supply.  I was doing the same thing with my daughter when she was born.  She kept crying too so I started supplementing because I also thought I wasn't making enough milk for her.  But like the above people have mentioned, your milk is still coming in and all that so don't panic.  I contacted La Leche League and they helped.

4240244,"My friend didn't tell me , but pushed me away instead? I really need help?","My best friend and i have been inseprible for over 10 years now. She all of a sudden started pushing me away and not letting me go anywhere near her. she told me she hated me and never wanted to see me again. 
This hurt so much, and i was lost without her. she said so many hateful things to me, and i returned the favour to her. well after 1 month of not talking her mum called me and told me she was in the hospital and really really sick.

I went to the hospital and found she has cancer and wouldn't be alive much longer, she could barely talk. she told me that she pushed me away because she wanted me to get used to her not being there before she had to leave. She died the next day...

She was like a sister to me, and now I'll never get to see her again, why couldn't she just tell me, i feel so guilty about the things i said to her, how can i feel better about it? i just wish i could say sorry...","first of all, your friend was trying to protect you.  When things go wrong like that we as humans always seem to hurt the ones we love and those closest to us. maybe she was trying to safe you the pain and anguish of having to watch her die.and I am sure she was scared, both of dying and of how you might react.  It is always hard when a life ends with unfinished busines like this. I am sure if you knew the facts, then you would not have said these things to her, but i am sure she will forgive you.  WHen you went to the hospital did you tell her you did not mean what was said, as I am sure she appologised as well.  Only thing that can help is yourself, you have to accept that this was not under normal circumstances that this happened, and your friend did start by saying hurtful things to you.  People deal with things differently in life and this was her way off dealing with things.

Best advice I can give is for you to give it time, and if time is not the answer then find someone who you can talk to, a friend, doctor or a councilor.  Try going to her grave and talk to her tell her you are sorry.  Perhaps you can raise funds in her name for the cancer unit at the local hospital as away of easing the burden.  If you are a believer in psychics and mediums, then they can help you con5tact her or pass on a message.  my e mail address if you need to chat is trishaf2001@yahoo.co.uk drop me a line f you want and we can go to msn and chat there  hope this helps.  just remember the good times

2872148,"I think I may have an axiety disorder, how do I know?","Granted there are things in my life that normal people would worry about but with me it seems some thoughts NEVER leave my mind. I worry, construct senario's in my mind and then worry about what if. I worry to the point that my pulse goes way up, I get splotches on my face, I feel like I can't breath and have a feeling that my thoughts must be true and often they are not. I'm really distressed about this because it's hurting those around me.","Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Symptoms

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is much more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It's chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint. Simply the thought of getting through the day provokes anxiety. 

People with GAD can't seem to shake their concerns, even though they usually realize that their anxiety is more intense than the situation warrants. People with GAD also seem unable to relax. They often have trouble falling or staying asleep. Their worries are accompanied by physical symptoms, especially trembling, twitching, muscle tension, headaches, irritability, sweating, or hot flashes. They may feel lightheaded or out of breath. They may feel nauseated or have to go to the bathroom frequently. Or they might feel as though they have a lump in the throat. 

Many individuals with GAD startle more easily than other people. They tend to feel tired, have trouble concentrating, and sometimes suffer depression, too. 

Usually the impairment associated with GAD is mild and people with the disorder don't feel too restricted in social settings or on the job. Unlike many other anxiety disorders, people with GAD don't characteristically avoid certain situations as a result of their disorder. However, if severe, GAD can be very debilitating, making it difficult to carry out even the most ordinary daily activities. 

GAD comes on gradually and most often hits people in childhood or adolescence, but can begin in adulthood, too. It's more common in women than in men and often occurs in relatives of affected persons. It's diagnosed when someone spends at least 6 months worried excessively about a number of everyday problems. 

Specific Symptoms of this Disorder:
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance). 

The person finds it difficult to control the worry. 

The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children don't need to meet as many criteria). 


restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge 
being easily fatigued 
difficulty concentrating or mind going blank 
irritability 
muscle tension 
sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep) 
Additionally, the anxiety or worry is not about having a Panic Attack, being embarrassed in public (as in Social Phobia), being contaminated (as in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), being away from home or close relatives (as in Separation Anxiety Disorder), gaining weight (as in Anorexia Nervosa), having multiple physical complaints (as in Somatization Disorder), or having a serious illness (as in Hypochondriasis), and the anxiety and worry do not occur exclusively during Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). 

The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. 

The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism) and does not occur exclusively during a Mood Disorder, a Psychotic Disorder, or a Pervasive Developmental Disorder",axiety disorder,,,NA,I'm really distressed about this because it's hurting those around me.,axiety disorder,,,"I worry, construct senario's in my mind and then worry about what if.",axiety disorder,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,"I think I may have an axiety disorder, how do I know?",,,,No

You should see an ENT to make sure there isn't anything organically wrong. A speech-language pathologist can then help you with possible voice treatment.

I figure that they probably need a good amount of time to heal completely, since they were ultrasound guided core biopsies, but sometimes the pain is very disconcerting, even though the twinges don't last a long time.  Is it possible for the biopsies to aggrivate the lumps and cause them to become something serious?  Thanks!","No,it will not aggravate the lumps and cause something serious.
I had a biopsy with removal of my breast lump at the age of 30 (I am 53 now).
Though I know that if I am diagnosed with Fibercystic Disease as was the case, new lumps can appear any time for the rest of our lives.
I had a girlfriend who had to have so many lump removals due to this disease that she eventually went ahead and had all of her breast tissue removed and replaced it with implants.(Her breasts had so many dimples due to the lump removals that the implants helped to smooth out her breast and took away future worry about more lumps,removal and the possibility of cancer.)
The older we get the more we really need to watch them as they can turn cancerous.
Avoiding cigarettes,caffine and chocolate is suppose to help lessen the possibility of having more problems with future lumps but I guess God has been on my side as I continue all 3 of them and have not had any problems(having gone thru menopause I suppose there is a possibility that I could start having problems,but so far so good.

2462213,Why wont he take better care of himself?,My boyfriend of two years is a type 1 diabetic. He is suposed to check his blood sugar frequently and administer injections when needed.

I just told a friend about your post he said tell her """"dump him and get a new boyfriend"""". But of course it is more complicated than that.
In my opinion coming from a female mind you...
He (your boyfriend) most likely hates the fact that he has this condition. He is a man...and a man does not take """"weakness"""" well. You can ask, cry, kick and scream but...it's up to him to take care of himself right. Just like people that need AA or in your case people that need Al lanon or therapy.

Go back and get more specific. Ask for options or reading material. Do a Web search (www.webmd.com is a good place to start), and get your own information. Sometimes you have to take charge of your own care. 

You also should ask the school about adaptive teaching for you. This is a disability and they can make accommodations.

37968,Is juice fasting helpful for a severe case of gall stones?,"My wife had a sonogram today and her gall bladder is FILLED with gall stones. The wall of her bladder has swollen to a thickness of 10.3 mm! Various """"cleanses"""" seem dangerous in this extreme of a case as they usually use olive oil to get the gall bladder contracting. That could be horrifyingly painful in such an extreme case of inflammation, methinks. I have heard that juice fasts can diminish the size of the stones slowly, but naturally. What do you think?

Do not flush unless months of stone reduction through apple juice and low fat/ low sugar/ low stress diet. I've done this, and as long as you are not in crisis, you can ususally do this - but do not rush into a GB FLUSH as it can be both painful and there is a small chance of pancreatitis (a stone spits into the pancreatic duct).

3921055,questions about milk allergies and lactose intolerance?,"My son is 20 months old. it seems like when he has milk he either throws it up or gets diarreah. This has been happening for almost a week now. At first I thought he was sick. I don't give him cups of milk that often, he gets calcium from other foods. Over the past month or more he has gotten sick requently and thinking back it seems to be after drinking milk. Some told me he may have a milk allergy or be lactose intolerant. The thing is he eats cereal with milk in it, he eats cheese and yogurt, he also eats ice cream. This doesn't sound like an allergy or anything to me, maybe just a coincidence? what do you think?","I could simply be a coincidence.  But you should probably bring it up with your pediatrician at your next visit.

I hope, for your son's sake, that it isn't anything serious.  I am lactose intolerant, and it's really annoying to have to check everything.  Lactose intolerence can actually start as a person gets older.  I didn't have a problem with dairy until I was almost seven.

The best advice I can give you for right now is to just make sure he's getting plenty of fluids (other than milk) and don't let him have any dairy for a while.

Just everything has to be very plain, no wheat, no sugar, basically no carbs, only veges and very lean protien. I had a gallbladder attack and they removed mine and I am only 27, after wards I did research and what I found out was very interesting, change your diet for a couple of weeks and see if that helps. I wish I would have known that, instead I had to lose a body part. I never had heartburn or issues before my attack, it just happened all of a sudden, but if you follow a low fat diet with no sugar you should be alot better in a couple of weeks.

Your stool is weird because your gallbladder is not releasing enough enzymes to break down the fat in your foods, so if you reduce or cut completely your fat intake your gallbladder will be able to catch up( I guess that is how you can word it).

Do a Spellcheck.  Doesn't your computer has that feature?  Your sister needs to see a GI (gastrointestinal specialist).  There are differential diagnosis for what she has.  Foremost that come to mind due to the duration of the diarrhea is  colon cancer, or the inflammatory intestinal disease- Crohn's disease

What is diarrhea?

Diarrheaï¿½loose, watery stools occurring more than three times in one dayï¿½is a common problem that usually lasts a day or two and goes away on its own without any special treatment. However, prolonged diarrhea can be a sign of other problems. People with diarrhea may pass more than a quart of stool a day.

Diarrhea can cause dehydration, which means the body lacks enough fluid to function properly. Dehydration is particularly dangerous in children and the elderly, and it must be treated promptly to avoid serious health problems. 

People of all ages can get diarrhea. The average adult has a bout of diarrhea about four times a year.

What causes diarrhea?

Diarrhea may be caused by a temporary problem, like an infection, or a chronic problem, like an intestinal disease. A few of the more common causes of diarrhea are

Bacterial infections. Several types of bacteria, consumed through contaminated food or water, can cause diarrhea. Common culprits include Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli. Food poisoning, intestinal fluare known causes.  


Viral infections. Many viruses cause diarrhea, including rotavirus, Norwalk virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and viral hepatitis.


Food intolerances. Some people are unable to digest some component of food, such as lactose, the sugar found in milk.


Parasites. Parasites can enter the body through food or water and settle in the digestive system. Parasites that cause diarrhea include Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium.


Reaction to medicines, such as antibiotics, blood pressure medications, and antacids containing magnesium.


Intestinal diseases, like inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease., or Crohn's Disease, 
Whipple Disease; ulcerative colitis,.


Functional bowel disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, in which the intestines do not work normally. Alcohol and laxative abuse are classified in here.   I'm diagnosed with this.  I'm taking Tagamet for it. No more cramps and diarrhea. 

How Is Diarrhea Treated?

If you have a mild case of diarrhea, you can just let it run its course, or you can treat it with an over-the-counter medicine.Common brand names include Pepto-Bismol, Imodium A-D and Kaopectate, which are available as liquids or tablets. Follow the instructions on the package. 

In addition, you should drink at least six 8-ounce glasses of fluid per day. Choose fruit juice without pulp, broth or soda (without caffeine). Chicken broth (without the fat), tea with honey and sports drinks are also good choices. Instead of drinking liquids with your meals, drink liquids between meals. Drink small amounts of fluids frequently. 

How Can I Relieve Discomfort in the Rectal Area



Some people develop diarrhea after stomach surgery or removal of the gallbladder. The reason may be a change in how quickly food moves through the digestive system after stomach surgery or an increase in bile in the colon that can occur after gallbladder surgery.

In most cases, replacing lost fluid to prevent dehydration is the only treatment necessary. Medicines that stop diarrhea may be helpful in some cases, but they are not recommended for people whose diarrhea is caused by a bacterial infection or parasiteï¿½stopping the diarrhea traps the organism in the intestines, prolonging the problem. Instead, doctors usually prescribe antibiotics. Viral causes are either treated with medication or left to run their course, depending on the severity and type of the virus

I lost four babies, two with ectopic pregnancy, one chemical preg and one blighted ovum. The month I was scheduled to have an hystersalpingogram (hsg) test, I got pregnant and now I am in my second trimester with a healthy baby in-utero.

I would suggest you ask your doctor about an hsg test. Basically the procedure involves shooting dye up your cervix, uterus and fallopian tubes. They then take an xray to check for blockages. Blockages are a major contributing factor for infertility in endo patients. The great thing about this test is that often times, the act of shooting the dye up into the fallopian tubes will clear them out enough to allow the sperm to enter and fertilize an egg and then allow the egg passage back to the uterus.

My husband and I decided to try one last time before the test and we used pre-seed which is a sperm friendly lubricant. It was the first and only time we had ever used this product-and low and behold two weeks later I had a positive hpt. If you are interested, just google """"preseed"""" and you should find it.

It happened when I was a virgin and when I wasn't. Sometimes it would be for one day sometimes it would go up to 2 weeks. When I got married we wanted to try right away for a baby (I was 21 by the way) and I couldn't get pregnant. After 3 years of trying we found out I had a disease called PCOS and that was what was causing the spotting. Also if you do get pregnant there is a 40% chance of losing the baby before 3 months which is a very high rate. So I do recommend you getting checked just to be sure. There are meds for almost any reproductive problem and it is good to start early on if you plan on having children in the future so your body is regulated.,Light brown spotting for more than 4 days after period,18-24 years old,Female,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This has never happened to me.,Light brown spotting for more than 4 days after period,,,,Yes: Do any of these problems that you mention happen if you're a virgin?

2552587,Swollen lump w/pain to touch and strange discomfort in lower abdomen/pelvic region.?,"I had not noticed anything at all and have become slightly bothered now without any information as to -what- it could be. Help?
The lump is slightly larger than 1 inch long, in an oval shape about 3/4-1inch thick.  I would guess the volume of about 1cubic inch total. It's hard, not squishy, and doesn't move more than a hair in any direction. It seems to be fine until I touch it. It's not like 'ouch!' painful, just tender. The skin around it is smooth and red, stretched a bit.  It's located dead-center between my belly button and gential area. Doesn't seem to be a lymphnode but I am not that familiar with lymphnodes.  When I gently pressed around it I noticed also that above my genital region the whole area (size of palm) is puffy. My lower gut and the general problem area has kind of had this faint ache sensation move through it quickly and then go away. I am not otherwise having problems. Any idea what this is, or could be? I really can't afford to see a doctor.","Lymph nodes are located off to the sides, not dead center in the abdomen.  I'm betting on a hernia.  Please read more about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia

Because you are female, this could certainly be something more profound and I agree with the others... you can't afford NOT to go to the doctor.  

Call your local Health Department, explain your situation, ask if there is a free or low cost way to be seen in your city/county.  If you experience intense pain, discomfort, fever or additional swelling, go to the Emergency Room and tell them that you have no insurance, but would like to speak with a social worker to see if you qualify for assistance or bill reduction.

Keep in mind that while it might cost a bit at this point, it will probably only get worse later, risk your health to a large degree and certainly won't get less expensive to treat... only more complex.

I will tell you that this does NOT sound like anything I can think of that would go away on its own.  Even fibroids would probably move a bit when you touch the area.  Hernias can be quite dangerous if they go untreated, so please make arrangements to be seen by a qualified physician.

Thanks in advance for all responses!","You should always eat something, or drink some OJ, when you take your insulin.  If you continue to have such low numbers, and your doctor doesn't do anything, get another opinion.  Your blood sugar level should never go that low.  Also make sure that your glucometer is properly calibrated.

As far as snacks go, the best thing to do IS to have small snacks between your meals and before bed.  That keeps your metabolism going.  Try a couple pretzels and a piece of cheese, or some apple and peanut butter.  Always make sure that you eat protein when you eat carbs.

Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. They arrange cosmetic and plastic surgery for foreigners in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as the breast reduction, tummy tuck, facelift and other cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.

2130483,I just had a bad weekend dealing with a migraine. But I thought I was just sick.?,"I have had these happen since I was about 16.

I noticed that it is triggered when I am working outside in the heat excerpting myself really hard with little or nothing to eat or drink previously.

738334,Asthma and food allergies ...need information on?,"My step son is 9 and has asthma  it runs in my husbands family.His mother is convinced that the only way to cure him is through stopping him from eating wheat,sugar and anything processed or unorganic.Im unsure how much nutrition has to do with healing asthma,although I do understand its obvious benifits.We would also love to not have him use puffers if possible as they seem to have caused an unhealthy dependence in my husbands family","As a Naturopath myself I see Asthma often. His mother is on track getting him away from wheat, refined sugars, Dairy. She should have these confirmed by a Naturopath first however as being allergens, in the majority of cases they are. Other things can be as well such as chocolate and food additives so a proper check is in order.

Asthma also has to do with repressed fear and anger/resentment. I use this technique with resounding success http://www.jentleearthhealing.com/tft.html If you like the look of this treatment then let me know and I will put you in touch with a practitioner near you. In most every case where I deal with this emotional/energetic side as well and release the blockage, there is a very rapid and almost permanent recovery so do NOT underestimate this as being causal and valid. Combining both is the key.

3320418,I have been living with insomnia for the past 20 years.?,"It is getting to the point now where I only get 3 to 4 hours sleep a night. I can not function right anymore, tired all the time. I have tried OTC sleepaids as well as prescription. Doctors also prescribed anti depressants to help me sleep, but all these medications do is make me dizzy, more tired and nauseous all day. I have tried valerian, hot milk, relaxing techniques and tapes, bla bla bla. Nothing works. At this point I am pretty much open to try anything no matter how crazy it sounds. lol (or not).","While I'm sure that JimmyR's links have this, I'll post it here:

I had a bad problem with insomnia for many years, and did some research on it.  Here are the things Iï¿½ve found that help the most.

1.  Don't take the sleeping pills.  Although they are not addictive in the way we tend to think (you won't jones for them if you miss taking them) they are addictive in the sense that once you have taken them for a while, you will have to take them to get to sleep, but they won't have the same effect they used too.   This is because you tend to not get the necessary REM sleep you need to be rested.  If you must take a sleeping pill, take it well before you go to sleep.  For instance, I prefer to take sleeping pills 2 hours before I go to sleep, so that the pill can get into my system and make me drowsy before I get into bed, then get out of my system (hopefully) early enough that I get some normal sleep.

2.  Try to go to bed at about the same time every night.  You have some wiggle room on this, but if you stay out on Saturday night till 3, it'll be harder to go to sleep at 10PM Sunday.

(Which somewhat contradicts:)

3.  If possible, don't go to bed if you're not sleepy.  Note  - one thing I have read and found to be true is that you have to be awake for 12 hours before you can go back to sleep.  So if you sleep till noon, again, you won't be sleepy at 10PM.  

4.  Don't spend more than 15-30 minutes trying to get to sleep.  If you notice that you've been in bed more than 15 minutes, get out of bed and do something for a while.  Make sure what you do isn't going to make you more hyper; e.g. no exercising or energetic music or writing posts to Great Debates (or reading GD for that matter ;) ). 

5.  When you go to bed, choose a chore or some other task that you do not want to do and tell yourself that if you are still awake in thirty minutes you will do that task.  Then, if you are still awake, get up and do your chosen task.  This is my favorite suggestion, as it has worked nearly every time I've used it. .

Those are the most useful suggestions I have.  Other things you can try:

Before you start getting ready for sleep, turn off high energy music and turn the lights down.  I love R&R music, but I went through a period where I had to turn the radio off every night about an hour before I went to bed, or I would be to wired to sleep. And our bodies react to reduced light by producing melatonin which puts us to sleep.  

Get plenty of exercise, but not right before bed.  (Unless you're weird like me - exercise right before bed just puts me to sleep)

Another suggestion that might work is to relax your body, consciously, one area at a time, starting from your feet. You think about the ball of your left foot and relax it, then the ball of your right foot, then the arch of your left foot, etc. You have to concentrate (pretty hard) on what you are doing.

Sex :D  by yourself or with an SO, it produces a nice soporific chemical, which does a nice job of putting you to sleep.",insomnia,,,NA,Nothing works.,insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,,,,At this point I am pretty much open to try anything no matter how crazy it sounds.,,,,,Not applicable

4148753,Could I have ruptured my eardrum?,"Recently I've had nausea, headache, a cold, and maybe a little bit of tonsilitis for three or four days.  During that time, my ears twinged a bit, but didn't really hurt until last night.  I was relaxing, working on a nice Sudoku puzzle when I tilted my head.  I felt and heard fluid moving somewhere inside my inner ear.  I tilted it at a sharper angle, and it hurt.  That triggered throbbing, aching pain that I couldn't ignore.  Ibuprofen did nothing for it.  It lasted for about two hours, and during that time I paced, watched Law & Order, and tried to sleep, but it just wouldn't go away.  Finally, when my sleeping pills kicked in, I yawned, and something happened.  It popped a little bit, and the fluid moved.  The pain went away.  I moved my head around and it throbbed just a bit, but it was basically gone.  I don't know if any discharge came out because I was under the influence of sleeping pills and went to sleep very shortly afterward.  Could my eardrum have ruptured?","You could have a perforation (a small, tiny hole) in your eardrum which results from pressure withing the middle ear and it is usually called Otitus Media.  If your eardrum burst you would have blood trickling out of your ear as well.  I have had this happen and the pain got so intense, even sleeping pills and/or painkillers didn't help. Up to the point of it bursting, it was incredibly painful.  As soon as it did burst, all the pain went away but there was blood coming out of my ear.  It was actually a relief to me because it was intensely painful and as soon as it burst, I had no earache anymore.  Burst tympanic membranes will heal and you should get some antibiotics to clear up the infection in your middle ear so it doesn't keep happening.

2718006,What are some warning signs of skin cancer?,"Well, I've been dating the same guy since the end of January.  He doesn't spend a lot of time in the sun and just recently started because I love it.  I've noticed, now that he has a tan, some white spots on his back.  He has a lot of moles and I've been watching them for any changes.  At first it was just the one, now he has three more and another one starting.  It's a complete lack of pigment, all circular, no irregular shapes, they don't hurt and the largest isn't changing.  It's all in an area where he just got a tatoo?  Could that have something to do with it?  I'm just concerned because more are forming and fairly rapidly.  Any answers would be helpful.  Thank you so much.","Symptoms of Skin Cancer: Skin cancer can look many different ways. The most common sign of skin cancer is a change on the skin, such as a growth or a sore that won't heal. Sometimes there may be a small lump. This lump can be smooth, shiny and waxy looking, or it can be red or reddish brown. Skin cancer may also appear as a flat red spot that is rough or scaly. Not all changes in your skin are cancer, but you should see your doctor if you notice changes in your skin. Melanoma can form from or near a mole, so it is important to have your health care provider check unusual (atypical) moles that are larger than others, have different colors, or that have irregular edges (borders). The American Academy of Dermatology says that if you notice a mole on your skin, look for the simple """"ABCD"""" warning signs of melanoma: 

Asymmetry ï¿½ one half does not match the other half. 

Border irregularity ï¿½ the edges are ragged, notched or blurred. 

Color ï¿½ the pigmentation is not uniform. Shades of tan, brown or black are present, causing a mottled, or splotchy, appearance. Dashes of red, white, and blue add to the mottled appearance. 

Diameter ï¿½ the width is greater than six millimeters (about the size of a pencil eraser). Any growth of a mole should be of concern. 

Malignant melanoma usually begins as a mottled, light brown to black flat blemish with irregular edges and is at least one-quarter inch in size. It can turn red, blue or white, or bleed and crust on the surface. 

A skin growth called actinic keratoses (AKs) can be the earliest sign of squamous cell carcinoma. AKs are small, scaly spots that form on body parts that have been exposed to the sun. They may start as small, red, flat spots then grow larger and become scaly or thick, like a wart. Most AKs form on the face or back of the hands

a) cold- usually around 40 degrees F or colder...
b) dust- wind has kicked up a lot of dust...
c) pollen- there's been a high pollen count (I do have spring-time allergies, so I'm not sure if this is another symptom if the hayfever.)

The tightness under my sternum has always taken many hours to go away- 8-10 hours, sometimes overnight. Occasionally, it will be a little less if I can shower right away and rinse off the dust or pollen.","Firstly, Asthma - The Symptoms are, coughing often at night, wheezing, a tight feeling in the chest and shortness of breath are common. Some people may have mild symptoms,while others have severe symptoms resulting in treatment in hospital.                                   Symptoms tend to be worse at night, and first thing in the morning.
       
                Asthma has become more common in the last 20yrs. In the Uk, more than 5 million people - about 1 in 7 children and 1 in 13 adults are believed to have it.

                  Excercise is good for Asthma, and sufferers should lead a normal. The risk is reduced by not smoking. Hous dust mite dung, pet hairs, smog and stress, also coughs and colds are triggers.

                    If you feel any of these are your symptoms, you should see a Dr. He or she would do a peak flow test, and then recommend any medication you would need, they may also suggest an allergie test.",asthma,25-34 years old,,,,,,,"I will have tightness in my chest, wheezing, etc.","tightness in my chest, wheezing",,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,Do I have asthma?,,,,,No

This has really gotten me worried since it has been 1 full day and I'm still suffering from it. Do you think I have a stomach virus or something?","Farmer Girls answer is simplistic and incorrect.  Eating pizza will not give you shivers, dizziness or loss of appetite.  Did you eat the pizza while it was hot?  If not, did you warm it up prior to eating it?
Bacteria grow on pizza as soon as it starts to cool down, generally you've got about 2-3 hours after delivery to enjoy your pizza before you have to nuke it or put in a toaster oven.
This bacteria can cause you to have the symptoms you describe above..they are very similar to the flu.
GI (gastrointestinal upset) occurs when bacteria enter the digestive tract and your body can't handle the toxin.  Your body fights back by trying to expell the bad stuff any way it can.  That's when you see the vomiting and diarrhea.  Your body is ridding itself of the toxin, so it's really a bad idea to take drugs like Immodium.
What you ABSOLUTELY have to do is to keep fluids down.  Drink water primarily, or go to the store and buy some Pedialyte (in the baby aisle)...they are the best things for you if  you are throwing up.
If your vomiting / diarrhea persists or you get dizzy, see your doctor pronto.  Make sure to have someone else drive you if possible.

All that excess fat presses on internal organs and can cause sluggish digestion and can press upward on the stomach causing pain. Time to find a good weight loss diet.

894753,Dr. Sam: HELP!! (for real this time...I can honestly say that I'm scared out of my mind)?,"I got a few crowns about four months ago and since then the gums directly above them have been tender and dark.  I got braces about a month after this.  Everything was fine until about three weeks ago when the gumline just above the crowns became inflamed.  I went to the dentist because i thought I had gingivitis but he said according to the x-rays everything looked fine.  He thinks I may have a small gap or hole between the crown and my gum.  I was given a prescription for pain relievers and antibiotics even though he said they won't do much.  He said that the periodontist may have to cut parts of my gum out and my gums might inflamed due to plaque getting trapped in my gums.  He said that I may have to get the crowns redone. 
Do you think this is something to be dealt with asap or can it wait a month?  What do you think is happening and what might happen if I do nothing but brush three times a day, floss daily, use Crest Pro-Health Rinse daily and use a flouride rinse daily?","I'm here, but a little busy lately...

Again and as always, please remember that I have not seen you or your x-rays and I am just speculating so that you might have a better understanding of what questions to ask the person who is actually treating you.

My first impression is that you should not immediately notice a change in your gums when you get crowns.  Maybe for a day or three, they will be irritated after having the cement cleaned away and so on, but they really should return to pretty much normal within a few days.  This suggests to me that the edge of the crowns (the """"margins"""") might not be technically the best possible, because this alone will canuse gum irritation.  I can't see or judge your crowns, but that is a red flag for me.

If you want to wait a month, that is up to you.  Again, I just can't see your gums, can I?  Unless you have something really horrible going on, a month will not usually make THAT much difference.  I am guessing that you want to wait until January 1 for a new insurance year.  Go ahead with the antibiotics for now and see what happens in the next couple of weeks.  Things don't generally move so fast that they are irreversible with minor gum irritations.

I would suggest that you see the periodontist and try to read between the lines and get his/her comments on how the crowns fir your teeth.  Since your dentist refers patients to this periodontist who relies on referrals for a living, you may not get a direct answer, but he/she won't tell a boldfaced lie,either.

In the meantime, you are right.  Just step up your home care to as nearly perfect as you can possibly manage.",gums,,,,,,,,He said that the periodontist may have to cut parts of my gum out and my gums might inflamed due to plaque getting trapped in my gums.,gum,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,Do you think this is something to be dealt with asap or can it wait a month?,,,,,No

I am still in TONS of pain every time I have my period and some times even when I'm not having my period, I've even now begun to """"spot"""" between my periods.

I am just tired of all this pain, I am so sick when I am on my period. What should I do??","I dont have endometriosis, but here is what i could find on it. Hope it helps you

The treatments for endometriosis pain include:
NSAIDs and other pain medication: They often work quite well as they not only reduce pain but also menstrual flow. They are commonly used in conjunction with other therapy. For more severe cases narcotic prescription drugs may have to be used.
Hormone suppression therapy: This approach tries to reduce or eliminate menstrual flow and estrogen support. Typically, it needs to be done for several months or even years. 
Progesterone or Progestins: Progesterone counteracts estrogen and inhibits the growth of the endometrium. Such therapy can reduce or eliminate menstruation in a controlled and reversible fashion. Progestins are chemical variants of natural progesterone.
Avoiding products with xenoestrogens, which have a similar effect to naturally produced estrogen and can increase growth of the endometrium.
Continuous birth control pills consists of the use of birth control pills without the use of placebo pills. This eliminates monthly bleeding episodes.
Danocrine is a suppressive steroid with some androgenic activity. Oral Danocrine inhibits the growth of endometriosis but its use is limited as it may cause hirsutism. There has been some research done at Case Western Reserve University on a topical Danocrine, applied locally, which has not produced the hirsutism characteristics. The study has not yet been published in a medical journal.
Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists) induce a profound hypoestrogenism by decreasing FSH and LH levels. While quite effective, they induce menopausal symptoms, and over time may lead to osteoporosis. To counteract such side effects some estrogen may have to be given back (add-back therapy).
Surgical treatment is usually a good choice if endometriosis is extensive, or very painful. Surgical treatments range from minor to major surgical procedures. 
Laparoscopy is very useful not only to diagnose endometriosis, but to treat it. With the use of scissors, cautery, lasers, hydrodissection, or a sonic scalpel, endometriotic tissue can be ablated or removed in an attempt to restore normal anatomy.
Laparotomy can be used for more extensive surgery either in attempt to restore normal anatomy, or at least preserve reproductive potential.
The definitive treatment for endometriosis is a total hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and surrounding tissue) and bilateral salpingoophorectomy (removal of the uterine tubes and ovaries).
For patients with extreme pain, a presacral neurectomy may be indicated where the nerves to the pelvis are cut.
A variety of alternative treatments are being used in patients with endometriosis, including acupuncture and nutrition.

Patients who are pregnant generally have less pain during pregnancy, and it is not unusual to have fewer symptoms after a pregnancy.

The only other suggestion I can make is try a hot water bottle. Just make sure it's not too hot, and rest it on your stomach before you go to bed.

I am a surgical asst. so I understand the anatomy and procedure and limitations, but I still have a question. I'm 34, in good health, reason for surgery was uncontrollable bleeding and endometriosis, and pelvic pain. My husband has a large penis and I continue to have painful intercourse. Is it possible that the cervical cuff can not accomidate his size, or is it just part of the healing process?","Although I concur with my colleague, Doc8, that it is entirely possible for you to have remaining endometrial implants, I would disagree that your complaint pattern is suggestive of endometriosis pain.

In a hysterectomy, the uterus, including the cervix, is removed.  The upper edge of the vaginal cuff which remains is sewn shut in a """"purse-string"""" fashion.  There is necessarily some loss of length within the canal because of tissue removal and the suture line involving even more tissue.  

The vagina is normally a highly compliant organ, which can stretch by length or diameter without much resistance.  However, after a hysterectomy, the former location of the uterus above the vaginal pouch is occupied by a raw space which fills with fibrous scar.  Scar tissue has a series of phases it goes through and for many many months, it is NOT compliant.  During the maturation phase of this scar tissue, I could easily envision that the normal compliance of your vagina has changed.  Now, there is significant resistance to stretch.

This is, of course, a guess.  However, the time period over which scar tissue matures and softens is well in excess of a year.  If my guess is wrong, then you'll know in about 6 to 12 more months when the problem still hasn't gone away.  

In the mean time, I would humbly suggest that you appeal to the basic principle of country doctoring:  If it hurts, DON'T DO IT! :)

3464579,My partner with Chlamydia?,"2 years ago, my partner who is from another country I might add, went to her country at that time. She tells me via email the doctors told her she has Clamydia, I was shocked by this information. She told me to get tested, I didn't because of my anger, and I knew I had to symptoms what so ever. Then she tells me she is getting treated for it over there, her country. She comes back no problems. Fast forward to now, she again visits her country and bang again, they tell her again she has Clamydia. So this time I get tested, and I already knew the results, I have nothing! Are the Doctors in that country for real, or is there something going on. My question is if you have Clamydia and get treated for it, does that totally remove the Clamydia from your system, or does it somehow stay in your system like herpes or something. Or until you have sex with another infected person do you get it again after treatment a few years ago???","First of all, with this """"ping pong volley"""" of chlamydia infection going on, you should know that there is strong probability of reinfection of this STD. For the infected person(s), there is a waiting time of at least a few weeks ,to a couple of months before they should engage in sex again, during treatment. A woman not treated could face possible infertility. STD's have no nationality or borders. Regardless of where she lives, one or both of you is not practicing safe sex! When sex is confined to marriage of two people faithful to each other, these type of problems can be avoided!

752813,Anyone know anything about Zoloft??,"Hi, I just got put on Zoloft for my depression and anxiety that I have been having for years... I've been taking for about 6 days now... The first week was horrible (expecially because I'm  in the service) I felt like I was on some crazy bad drugs in my own little world and I don't really remember much of last week but now everything seems to calm down a lot!  Now I just get really bad headaches on oneside of my head and its hard for me to goto sleep and I'm very sleepy during the day...for the first day or so I tried to take it during the day, but I was just to tired so I started to take it at night.  My question is, will these headaches and my sleeping get better over the next few weeks??  Thank you!","This is best answered by the doctor that prescribed this medication for you.  However, I was on Zoloft for a period of time.  With anti-depressants it takes approximately 4-6 weeks to see the full effects on your mental health.  It usually, like any drug you take, affects your body in a negative way for a short period of time (i.e. side effects).  This time depends on your body and the way it reacts.  For me, my body was used to it after the first week or so.  So I would recommend waiting 2 weeks then possibly calling your doctor regarding your side effects.

Oh, and the comment above about it taking 3-4 months to go away is completely incorrect.  Again, it depends on your body, but for the normal individual side effects from drugs usually disappear within 1 to 2 weeks (at most) of discontinuing the drug.",Zoloft,,,,,,,,,,The first week was horrible (expecially because I'm  in the service) I felt like I was on some crazy bad drugs in my own little world,Zoloft,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,"My question is, will these headaches and my sleeping get better over the next few weeks?",,,,,No

1083886,Please help my serious SINUS problems!?,"I have had constant sinus problems for over 5 years.  It started out with nosebleeds occuring often and now I get horrible headaches and it feels, at times, like my brain is becoming detatched from my head! I get constant post nasal drip, and it's really dry feeling.  They're always swollen and it's difficult to breath.  

I was put on antibiotics first, that didn't work. Then I was put on 3 different nasal sprays, not sure what they were but I know there were steriods in some of them, they didn't help.  I am currently using what is called a Netti Pot, which you put a mixture of salt water in and run it through your nose, and that helps the soothing.  But nothing FIXES!! Please someone tell me what I need to do!!","The thing with the neti pot is that you must continue to do it.  It's not going to """"fix"""" you.  Western medicine encourages us to think we can find a pill to """"fix"""" us, but generally it's lifestyle changes that make us healthier.  I don't know about what lifestyle changes would help you, but perhaps a naturopath or ayuvedic physician would.

I was, in fact, """"cured"""" by nasal flushes.  But when things get dry, or if my allergies begin to act up, I need to flush daily.  When I feel an infection coming on, I do it twice a day, and when I have an infection, maybe even as frequently as hourly (it helps if you're home in bed drinking fresh organic vegetable broth and resting).  The mixture I use is 8 oz water w/ 1/4 tsp each baking soda and salt.  I don't use a neti pot, I use a baby nasal aspirator, but I don't know how important that difference is.

I have torn the rotator cuffs of both my shoulders and a surgeon says , after an MRI, that I need surgeries--two of them, left first, right later.

Right now, I am mildly inhibited only. I can still bathe, dress, and do basic household tasks. I even pull the start cord for my dad to mow the lawn.

But I cannot push even pillows or clothing up onto a shelf above my head in the closet. And I have mild difficulty in putting clothes out to dry on a clothesline.

I know that all surgery is risky.
I am a recoering alcoholic, too, so I hesitate to go under general 
anesthesia. I also hesitate to have to wear slings or cats on my arms for weeks or months, temporarily becoming more """"disabled"""".

No abuse!!","funny you should ask...i just had arthoscopic surgery done last friday...in much the same way that they would do the rotator cuff...mine was dislocated and they fixed the cartilidge to prevent it from happening again...

it's a big decission - but not that the surgery is over, i'm so glad i did it...

i was in much of the same situation as you were...limited mobility....above my head...but, was still healing from the dislocation...

i have minimal pain - and today being 4 days after, haven't takenthe pain meds at all...my mobility is pretty good...i do have a sling, and will have to do some physical therapy in a week or so, but the doc tells me that after that my mobility should be back to almost normal.....

sling is only going to be on for about 10-14 days...

i work as a counselor for people in 12-step programs - i'm assuming that your fear is for the drugs afterwards?  i;m sure if you spoke with the surgeon he could figure something out...don't use it as an excuse.....

anyway...not sure if i helped or not...in my opinion the surgery isn't as bad as i expected it to be....and only 4 days later it is already feeling ok...

3319312,I seriously need HELP?,"I have an eating problem, I know that i have ben stressed out lately and I seem to be self medicating with food, most of all I dont want to admit that it is related to stress and so I just associate my eating habits with a growing appeite. So I am asking does anyone know of a diet pill that surpresses my  appeite and reduce stress level? I know there are tons of diet pills but one that specifically deal with decrese of appeite and stress. i.e last week i weighed 120lbs know Iam up to 126lbs is it normal to gain 6lbs in a week?","The diet pill will only work for a short period of time because your need to eat will overpass it because you have not dealt with your """"emotional eating"""" problems.  When you have emotional eating problems, you don't eat because you are hungry, you eat because you are having to deal with an emotional problem.  So having   no appeite with the help of a diet pill means nothing to an emotional eater  because you don't eat because you are hungry.  Keep in mind the following:


 Diets can work but because we know so little about ourselves and our relationship with food, it makes it difficult to win the battle. A lot of us have problems with dieting because we have a problem called """"emotional eating"""" we eat to comfort ourselves during difficult, stressful, sad, etc times in our lives.

You may experience all those emotions during dieting as we continuously get on the scale hoping to see a big difference in numbers after dieting only for a day or two. Also what is stressful when dieting is that we try to lose a large number of weight in such a short period of time which in most cases is unreasonable. 

This all brings about stress, discomfort and sadness. When we feel this way, we turn to our best friend for help and support which for many of us is food. The diet is now broken and we feel that we can't stick to diets. We then try fad diet after fad diet hoping to lose the original 20 pounds and now we may have as much as 30 pounds to lose because we continue to put on weight as we continue to break these fad diets by binging before starting our next diet. 

Please learn about your relationship with food before your next diet so that you may achieve your goals. To help a little, keep in mind the following:

You already know how to lose weight. You know that if you eat less and exercise more eventually youï¿½ll see the pounds come off. Whatï¿½s getting in your way? Why do you usually regain the weight you lost? The answer to all these questions is the same ï¿½Emotional Eating.ï¿½ Simply defined, emotional eating means you eat to satisfy emotional hunger; it means you use food for comfort or as a way to cope with life; and it means you eat for reasons other than what your body needs. Whenever you reach for a boredom-breaking snack despite your commitment, or whenever you eat to quell anxiety, thatï¿½s emotional eating. Whenever you binge after a fight, or double up on portions because your day turned sour, thatï¿½s emotional eating. Whenever you feel that sharp craving for your favorite food, thatï¿½s emotional eating. When we eat during these times while on a diet, we believe the diet doesnï¿½t work or that we lack self control and then look for the quickest way to lose weight (fasting/diet pills, ect) after eating all we can since we already messed the diet day up. Read the information below but remember that emotional eating plays a big part in why we donï¿½t continue dieting and why we regain lost weight and why we binge today and start a new diet tomorrow. Best of Luck.

P.S. After learning about my relationship with food, I was able to drop my weight from 263 pounds down to 151 pounds which is a 112 pound weight lost.",eating problem,,,NA,"I have an eating problem, I know that i have ben stressed out lately and I seem to be self medicating with food, most of all I dont want to admit that it is related to stress and so I just associate my eating habits with a growing appeite.",eating problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,So I am asking does anyone know of a diet pill that surpresses my  appeite and reduce stress level?

2028489,A question about NHS acupuncture in the UK?,"You can only get acupuncture on the NHS from a Gp that is registered as an acupuncturist.  They will most likely have had the minimal training in the field of acupuncture, will probably not know a thing of 5-element theory let alone prescribe herbal remedies.
TCM theory has treatment for things like sinusitis, sciatica, neuralgia and even neuralgia.  And 5-element theory treats mental dis-ease very well too.
A mainland China trained physician has had 7 years of university education behind them.  Why can they not practice within the NHS?

However, on the mid-right (my right) side of the edge of my tongue, there is a circular patch that is quite a pronounced red, with no coating at all. It is about 1 centimetre in diameter.

My acupuncturist use to tell me which organs were represented by each area but I've forgotten. What interests me most is why this patch doesnt have the white coating?","First off, you may want to go get this checked out by your doctor. First check and see if the white stuff on your tongue can easily be scraped off.  If it can, then it is most likely a candida (yeast) infection.  Any condition in which your immune system drops (such as prolonged used of antibiotics, corticosteriods, or immunocompromising diseases like AIDS, chemotherapy, etc.) can predispose you to this infection. This infection can also cause redness of the tongue without the white coat.  If it is oral candidiasis, also called oral thrush, then antifungal treatment can be prescribed to you by a doctor. Now if the white stuff can not be easily scraped off, then the diagnosis is most likely something called leukoplakia that could be precancerous.  Either way, see a doctor.

She says she is going to go to the gym but doesn't seem to be doing anything about it. She doesn't eat heaps (around me anyway) but she doesn't have a high metabolism either. I enjoy tramping and getting outdoors in genral and she says she likes the same but she always finds an excuse not to go and I think it's because she's afraid she can't keep up. I have never criticised her about her weight but I feel I may say something soon and I want it to be the right thing.,"First of all, to the guy who said """"get another girl..a slim one of course"""" you are mean, and didn't even address the question. Not everyone is as superficial as you are.

Now, if you think she's cute, and are mostly dissapointed that you can't enjoy physical activities with her because she always finds excuses not to go, then I suggest that you kindly explain to her that its something you really enjoy, and something you want her to be a part of, and that you can take it slow if she wants. I think you're right about her being afarid she won't be able to keep up (thats how I'd feel) 

You could also just stop by her house and ask her to take a walk with you, or take her to go swimming at a lake or something...activities that are romantic as well as counting as excersise. Once she is able to be comfortable around you in these sort of situations, she'll agree to them more and more, and most likely start to lose a bit of weight. 

And if she says she goes to the gym, why not suggest that the two of you go together? 

Just keep in mind that healthy weight loss takes a lot or work, pateince and time - and this applies to you as well as her. Be supportive and don't get impatient.

3831743,My friend's son has been diagnosed with Asperger's Disorder...?,"He has no physical disability or abnormality. He seems to ignore the world around him, he seldom speaks just babbles but it is not that he does not know how to speak - it depends on his mood and sometrimes he just utters one or 2 words. He is 4 year. What's the pronosis? What's the best treatment possible for him? He does not make eye contact, rarely responds to people and always seems to be engrossed in his own world.","Asperger's Syndrome is a condition similar to autism, and the educational approaches work working with both are often similar. About the prognosis, I would say that it is often good, so don't despair! People with Asperger's Syndrome have won nobel prizes (Vernon Smith), become famous actors (Dan Ackroyd), or become successful computer programmers, scientists, etc.

To help your friend's child maximize his potential, I would recommend the following educational approaches. Since every child is different, these may or may not apply to your situation or work for you. I would encourage you to keep trying and find a system that works for you friend and their family. She may have already done so, but I would also recommend keeping in close contact with the child's teacher and school to make sure that he  is getting the support needed. Hope this helps! 

- Recognize your child's strengths and interests and use these as opportunities for education (for example, if your child is very interested in Star Wars, you can teach math problems about Star Wars, make cleaning up into a game about Jedi powers, etc.) You never know when an interest may turn into a possible career option for the future (I recently read a book written by a man with Asperger's who made his childhood interest in """"The Wizard of Oz"""" into seveal job opportunities! [""""Demystifying the Autistic Experience"""" by William Stillman""""]) (Source #1)

- People with autism/Asperger's are often visual learners and learn well with pictures, charts, step-by-step written instructions, etc. (Source #1)

- Consider reading books by authors with Autism/Asperger's (while these are often geared towards adults, I think they offer valuable information) Authors to consider include Temple Grandin, Edgar R. Schneider, Jerry Newport, Stephen Shore, and William Stillman (Source #1)

- I would also advise you to often require him to look at your or participate in some activity with you. Just anything so that he is engaged with you. If he does not respond, you could repeat your instruction, wait, then (if necessary) gently prompt him physically to give you a high-five by touching your hand to his or something like this. Then, when he does it, reinforce this behavior with lots of praise and perhaps a small portion of a favorite snack or something else he likes. It is importnat that he is engaged with a person or an activity (such as reading or a puzzle, etc) on a somewhat frequent basis. That being said, he also will most likely need some time where he is allowed to relax and """"be engrossed in his own world."""" You may also want to develop a system where he can say one word or hand you a card with the word """"break"""" written on it so that he can tell you when he is feeling overwhelmed and needs a break from the situation or activity. (Source #1)

- To motivate him to use language, you could, for example if you know he wants juice, don't just give it to him becuase you know that's what he wants. Have him say, """"juice,"""" or if he is not ready for that yet, just the first sound of the word before you give him any juice. Gradually, very slowly, require him to say additional words such as, """"want juice,"""" then """"want juice please,"""" then """"I want juice please, etc."""" before you give him the juice. Start with him requesting with one word for most of the things he wants, before starting to require sentences. (Source #1)

    plzzzzzzz reply me if u r a docter or good adviser","Conditions associated with pectus excavatum include Marfan syndrome, Poland syndrome, and Pouter pigeon breast:

Marfan syndrome

The Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder. Connective tissue provides substance and support to tendons, ligaments, blood vessel walls, cartilage, heart valves and many other structures. In the Marfan syndrome, the chemical makeup of the connective tissue isn't normal. As a result, many of these structures aren't as stiff as they should be.

The Marfan syndrome is inherited and affects many parts of the body. There's no single conclusive test for diagnosing it, but people who have it often have many similar traits. Besides perhaps having heart problems, people with the Marfan syndrome are often tall and thin. They also may have slender, tapering fingers, long arms and legs, curvature of the spine and eye problems. Sometimes the Marfan syndrome is so mild that few (if any) symptoms exist. In the most severe cases, which are rare, life-threatening problems may occur at any age.

Poland syndrome

Poland syndrome consists of a deficiency of subcutaneous fat and muscles on one side of the body. It may include underdevelopment of the arm, hand, and fingers on the same side, and may be associated with other conditions such as Moebius syndrome or Klippel-Feil syndrome. The right side of the body is affected twice as often as the left.

It is difficult to determine how many individuals are affected by Poland syndrome, since mild cases may go unnoticed or be misdiagnosed. One study estimated that it may occur in 1 in 30,000 individuals. Poland syndrome does seem to affect males more commonly than females.

Symptoms
Poland syndrome has several distinctive symptoms:

    * Chest muscle deformities - absence of the pectoralis minor and the breastbone part of the pectoralis major
    * Undedevelopment or absence of breast or nipple on the affected side
    * Patchy absence of hair under the arm on the affected side 

Additional symptoms on the affected side may include:

    * Underdeveloped or missing ribs
    * Underdeveloped arm, hand, and fingers
    * Abnormally short, webbed fingers

I'm really sorry about the pleurisy it can be extremely painful. If you are experiencing any ittching that is sometimes associated with it then you could take OTC Benadryl and that would serve double duty as it would not only help the itching, but also the nausea. 

As always, consult your physician and pharmacist before talking any medications, and I wish you the best.

---------------------------------
Edit:
Regarding the latter posters and allergic reactions:
It's a common misconception that nausea and vomiting is a sign of an allergic reaction, it's not, it's a normal however undesirable side effect of the drug. Most drugs have such side effects along with headache, dizzyness and somnolence. Allergic reactions are caused when the body's  immune system attacks a normally harmless substance (the allergen). The immune system calls upon a protective antibody called immunoglobulin E or IgE to fight these invading substances. The large IgE release ends up causing mast cells to be injured or irritated and they release a variety of strong chemicals, including histamine, into the tissues and blood. This causes the itching, swelling, and fluid leaking from nearby cells. These chemicals cause the familiar signs of an allergic reaction that we all recognize,  itching, airway and throat tightening, hay fever and allergic rhinitis to name just a few.",Nausea,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Is it the Percoset?

But is the limited food intake comparable to anorexia?  I understand that a large person cannot be anorectic, because being anorectic involves having distorted image of ones self.  Isn't rapid weight loss a sign of anorexia?  And isn't the rapid weight loss a result of not being able to eat, either physically or emotionally, wouldn't that be considered anorexia also?

I am not trying to be disrespectful, I am just trying to understand this.  I have struggled with an eating disorder in the past, and I have  friends who  had weight loss surgery.  I see them acting the same ways as I have in the past.  I want to notice if something is wrong.","Weight Loss surgery is not healthy and it should only be used for the morbidly obese (in other words if they dont get the surgery they will die in five years). Too many people are getting the gastric bypass surgeries as an easy fix. And the doctors are eager to give them since they and the hospital makes big bucks. They say they council these men and women but they still offer them so much more that the fear is subdued.

Here is the problems with Weight Loss Surgery:
You could die on the table
You could die later from complications
You could die from malnourishment
You can have many illnesses from lack of nutition
You dont do well in pregnancy since it is hard for the baby to get 
      the nourishment it needs
Your stomach can stretch back out over time if you overeat
For a long time you can only eat a Tablespoon of food at a time
      eat more than that or rich food and you throw up. Many 
      surgery patients throw up alot.
You are on supplements the rest of your life
This surgery is irreversible, so if you dont like your life after
       you dont have a choice. No going back.
These patients lose all joy surrounding food (parties, dinner out)
This surgery is not natural for your body.

These are just a few reasons to find another way. Anorexia is not the answer either as it also has many health risks. The best way to lose weight is to eat less, exercise, eat more natural diet, and be happy (sadness and depression cause weight gain).

Hoodia is a good natural pill (derived from cactus in Africa) to supress the appetite to get the fat off. As the fat comes off you will naturally eat less and better. You can do Weight Watchers as it is the most tested of all plans and it works. Never try to lose more than 2-3 lbs per week or you will gain it back plus some. Slow is the best. Weight only once a week as that is the only time it is acurrate (water weight).
Then to keep it off, just do your weekly weight in and if it is up, cut back a little for the week.

218962,Diagnosed Diabetes?,"Hello all, im new in the forums and to diabetes as well. However i have a Question i went to the doctor like a month ago due to a few palpitations i had (not related to diabetes i guess), and he ordered a bunch of tests for me to do.

In the Fasting one i had 92 on the sugar count (i have always been in the 85-95) range all my life, however he decided to make the glucose tolerance test, the reading i got when i got there was 91 then after the first hour i got 210 he said the maximun was 200, and then in the second hour i had 170 he said the maximun was 140, by the third hour i was back to 86. After seeing my results he said i was a Diabetic prescribed no meds only to lose weight (im like 40 pounds overweight) and exercise.

Im also been taking beta blockers a week and a half prior to the test (25mg every night) and i wondered if that may influence the test somehow, so what do you guys think?","Sorry, I don't know the answer to the beta blocker part of your question.  If you're continuing to take them I strongly suggest you do some online research; there's a lot of junk info to wade through, but it will give you a better idea of side effects, differing opinions, etc.

As to the diabetes diagnosis:  I think you've been diagnosed pre-diabetic.  If it were full-blown diabetes you WOULD be on medication.  I had the same diagnosis, and with some lifestyle changes (excuse the phrase) I brought my sugar back into the normal range within 3 months.  Some things to do:

1)  Avoid processed sugar and processed grains.  READ LABELS.  Lots of things have high fructose corn syrup in them.  And if the first ingredient is """"wheat flour"""" it's been processed.  You're looking for bread whose first ingredient is """"whole wheat flour.""""  It's not that you can never eat them, but try to avoid them whenever possible.  It's hard to do if you're eating out a lot.

2)  Increase your fiber intake, especially soluable fiber.  Oatmeal, apples, there's plenty of information about this on the internet.  Lots of soluable fiber helps your body regulate the insulin/sugar balance.

3)  Excercise.  A simple 20 minute walk after lunch or dinner.  Put on some music and dance.  You're not trying to buff up or lose weight, but to increase your metabolism.

4)  If you live where you can go to a reputable acupuncturist, I really recommend you give it a try.  It can really help balance your system, which is the goal you're aiming for.

5)  Take 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon every day.  This is not as nutty as it sounds.  There's some excellent research that it helps long term diabetics -- even my doctor had heard of it! -- and it can't hurt.

If you cut down on processed sugar and grain, and move you body more, you will lose weight, although slowly.  I would NOT recommend going on a diet of any sort, because you're trying to get your body to work in a more balanced and efficient way, and any kind of extreme eating is going to screw that up.

Now the thing is she is not only having pain in this area but she has been getting headaches,backaches, and numbness in her legs. And when she goes through metal detectors she sets them off. We were told by the cop that passed her over with a wand once and whom we had told that she would set them off because of the metal surgical clips that the clips should not set the alarms off cause they are suppose to be made of titanium and that does not set their metal detectors off. So why is she setting off the metal detectors then?","titanium is still a metal, therefore, the metal detectors are just doing their job. The difference is, she shouldn't be setting off the alarms when she leaves the stores. The clips she is seeng are more likely from her tubal proceedure than her c-section though.

what they do with common hernias is go in through a lapriscope and sew in a piece of mesh to hold the area so it can heal properly, I am not totally certain they do the same with umbilical hernias.

that said.  Even the best Root canals even fail, done by the best Specialist.   You can't say so & so did wrong based on the patients impression.

To feel completely separated from your sense of Self and your body goes hand-in-hand with eating disorders. Do you self-injure, too?

An eating disorder is actually a means of someone asserting control over their life when they feel they have very little. It is rarely a symptom of someone who wants to be thin, though it's very common that someone w/an eating disorder hates themself and wants to do themself harm.

Bulimia is a very common disease with successful, charismatic women who endure a lot of stress at work or in life in general.

I had to come at my bulimia and self-harm from a few different angles. Firstly, I got myself a good book -- The Secret Language of Eating Disorders by Peggy Claude-Pierre. I read it and took note of the things she said that resonated with me most.

I saw a therapist once a week for two years. It was pricey but completely necessary. It helped more than I can describe. Just telling someone about how awful you feel and how alienated you think you are, and having them console you and validate your feelings, is powerfully healing.

Start to write down things you like about yourself. Keep track of details  during the day that make you feel connected to yourself. Treat yourself to things throughout the day -- a positive thought, an inside joke with yourself, a cup of tea, anything.

I can relate to wanted to go back to your eating disorder. It feels safe and consistent and when you look at yourself and see your body as the result of your own control, well, it feels great. A therapist will help you with this. find a support group and meet with the people there.

Anyone have any ideas that I can bring up with my doctor tomorrow?","It could very well be lupus because your symptoms fit the typical symptoms of that disease. Lupus is an autoimmune disease affecting mostly women and causing various effects throughout different parts of the body. Its severity can range from very mild to extremely serious depending on which body organs are afflicted. 

Lupus is difficult to diagnose and often misdiagnosed unless there is a characteristic symptom such as the butterfly-shaped rash over the cheeks. There is no single definitive blood test for lupus and doctors have to make the diagnosis based on a variety of symptoms and diagnostic tests. Lupus is one of a group of conditions with vague symptoms such as fatigue or malaise, and may need to be distinguished from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, depression, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, or various other conditions. If the main symptoms are joint symptoms, then various other causes of arthritis need to be considered. (Source: WD Writers) 

Lupus (also called systemic lupus erythematosus or SLE) is a disorder of the immune system which normally functions to protect the body against invading infections and cancers. In lupus, the immune system is over-active and produces increased amounts of abnormal antibodies that attack the patient's own tissues. Lupus can affect many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, lungs, heart, nervous system, and blood vessels. The signs and symptoms of lupus differ from person to person, and the disease can range from mild to life-threatening.

2.  Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour/interest/activitiy  -  do you have these?  You didn't mention any so I assume the answer is no.  They would include a pre-occupation with parts of objects or non-cunctional routines or rituals.

3.  Clinically significant impairment in social or occupational (employment) functioning  -   can you hold down a job?  Maintain relationships?

The ones that MAY cause abortions are; The Pill, Implants, Shots, Patches, and Vaginal Ring.

There are many methods of birth control that do not cause abortions (or cancer). They are called """"barrier methods"""" and they include; abstinence, periodic abstinence (a.k.a. Rhythm Method), condom (male and female versions), diaphragm, cervical cap, Spermicides, and/or surgical sterilization.

Maybe start talking to him about his mom, like saying ""did your mom like to........"" and then let him open up.

This kid is fed on junk food ALL THE TIME! Her first solid was a french fry. The eat KFC, Macdonalds EVERY NIGHT. They would have a home cooked meal maybe once a month and when she stayed over here, to my horror, they had Coke and sweet biscuits for breakfast. I am not asking you to judge her parental skills nor the fact that she really needs to start feeding her Children properly - I am asking for information about how this is caused.","The medical profession isn't certain exactly what causes diabetes in children, otherwise known as type 1 or insulin-dependent diabetes.  For some unknown reason the organ called the pancreas shuts down.
It is important to understand that juvenile diabetes is different from type 2 diabetes, which occurs in adults and is usually related to a weight problem or otherwise unhealthy lifestyle.
I was diagnosed with type 1 when I was 12.  My parents were health-food nuts and had never allowed me to eat junk food, candy, or soda during my childhood.  I was an active and normal kid.  There was no history of this disease in my family either.
My point is that no one really knows for sure why this happens.  What I can tell you is that it will be a difficult thing to cope with at first.  The parents of this child will need your support and understanding during this time.  It sounds like it will be a huge adjustment for the whole family.  If you cook yourself, then why not spend some time with them sharing healthy recipes?  (There are also many diabetic cookbooks on the market now.)

they get worse and worse over the years,and i hate taking so much medicine.is there long term damage from migraines,i mean that much pressure and pain can't be good in the long run,sometimes i feel like i'm going to die from the pain.
i think sometimes this crap is going to seriously kill me,like give me an aneurism or something.can something like this happen?","Possible symptoms of migraines
Intense throbbing or dull aching pain on one side of your head or both sides. 
Nausea or vomiting 
Changes in how you see, including blurred vision or blind spots 
Being bothered by light, noise or odors 
Feeling tired and/or confused 
Stopped-up nose 
Feeling cold or sweaty 
Stiff or tender neck 
Light-headedness 
Tender scalp 

Are there different kinds of migraine headaches? 
Yes. The most common are classic migraine and common migraine.

Classic migraines start with a warning sign, called an aura. The aura often involves changes in the way you see. You may see flashing lights and colors. You may temporarily lose some of your vision, such as your side vision.

You may also feel a strange prickly or burning sensation, or have muscle weakness on one side of your body. You may have trouble communicating. You may also feel depressed, irritable and restless.

Auras last about 15 to 30 minutes. Auras may occur before or after your head pain, and sometimes the pain and aura overlap, or the pain never occurs. The head pain of classic migraines may occur on one side of your head or on both sides.

Common migraines don't start with an aura. Common migraines may start more slowly than classic migraines, last longer and interfere more with daily activities. The pain of common migraines may be on only one side of your head. 

How long do migraines usually last? 
Migraines may last from 4 to 72 hours. They may happen only once or twice a year, or as often as daily. Women are more likely to have migraines than men.

What things may set off a migraine? 
Certain things that can set off migraines in some people include the following:

Strong or unusual odors, bright lights or loud noises 
Changes in weather or altitude 
Being tired, stressed or depressed or the let-down after a stressful event 
Changes in sleeping patterns or sleeping time 
Certain foods (see the list below), especially those that contain tyramine, sodium nitrate or phenylalanine 
Missing meals or fasting 
Menstrual periods, birth control pills or hormones 
Intense physical activity, including sexual activity 

 Foods that may trigger migraines
Aged, canned, cured or processed meat, including bologna, game, ham, herring, hot dogs, pepperoni and sausage

Aged cheese

Alcoholic beverages, especially red wine

Aspartame

Avocados

Beans, including pole, broad, lima, Italian, navy, pinto and garbanzo

Brewer's yeast, including fresh yeast coffee cake, donuts and sourdough bread

Caffeine (in excess)

Canned soup or bouillon cubes

Chocolate, cocoa and carob

Cultured dairy products, such as buttermilk and sour cream

Figs

Lentils
 Meat tenderizer

Monosodium glutamate (MSG)

Nuts and peanut butter

Onions, except small amounts for flavoring

Papaya

Passion fruit

Pea pods

Pickled, preserved or marinated foods, such as olives and pickles, and some snack foods

Raisins

Red plums

Sauerkraut

Seasoned salt

Snow peas

Soy sauce
 
 What about prescription medicines? 
People with more severe pain may need prescription medicine. A medicine called ergotamine (brand name: Ergostat) can be effective alone or combined with other medicines. Dihydroergotamine (brand names: Migranal, D.H.E. 45) is related to ergotamine and can be helpful.

Other prescription medicines for migraines include sumatriptan (brand name: Imitrex), zolmitriptan (brand name: Zomig), naratriptan (brand name: Amerge) rizatriptan (brand name: Maxalt), almotriptan (brand name: Axert), eletriptan (brand name: Relpax) and frovatriptan (brand name: Frova).

If the pain won't go away, stronger medicine may be needed, such as a narcotic (brand name: Stadol nasal spray) or medicines that contain a barbiturate. These medicines can be habit-forming and should be used cautiously.

now she will re gain part of the lost functions because after a stroke, edema of the brain develops and is maximal a couple of days after the onset of stroke, this edema will cause even more functional loss but it is reversible, with time (weeks) the edema subsides and the neurons return to normal function. anyway, she still has a dead part of the brain but other parts of the brain can take the function of the dead tissue and so she may regain more functions and that's done by physiotherapy. rehabilitaion is very important for her.

1049932,Is it a seizure?,"My 13 year old daughter started having """"episodes"""" (for the lack of a better word) about 6 months ago. She has had 3 this week though and I am scared. She is having severe chest pain with pain running down the left arm (she says like a throbbing pain), trouble beathing; like she is choking, and she passes out. When this happens she is pretty much out for 30-45 minutes. Afterward she is fine with no visible side effects. Upon taking her to the emergency room and running of tests doctors have found no cause. She is set to see a neurologist next week. Before this week she had only had 3 of these episodes total; but 3 in one week really scares me. I have not seen any common thread or trigger of these episodes.","Although I would not want to guess what is actually the problem, it doesn't sound like a seizure, at least not an epileptic seizure of any sort.  A grand mal seizure is characterized by the uncontrolled jerking and """"seizing"""" of the entire body that one usually thinks of as a seizure.  There isn't usually any pain associated with it prior to the onset, although some people do report an aura of lights or such just before it happens.  After the seizure passes, the person regains control and consciousness, but they are extremely tired and sleepy, and sometimes disoriented. In petit mal seizures there is a sort of """"checking out"""", usually the person stares off into space for several minutes, and comes back without realizing much has happened. There are variations, but none of them involve pain, breathing difficulties, or passing out in that sense.  So while whatever is wrong is definitely in need of being further evaluated, I would say that epilepsy is not one of the things to be a concern.
  The neurologist will likely order an MRI, CAT Scan, and several other neurological tests, along with some cardiac testing to eliminate that as a possible cause.  Until those results are all in, he likely won't be able to give you many answers.  In the meantime, though, you can ask him what sort of precautions you should take to keep her safe.  I'd imagine they wouldn't want her doing anything really physically demanding, sports or anything like that.   Hopefully you can get the answers you need fairly soon, and be able to put your mind at ease.  I'm sorry I can't offer more help than this.

I can't specifically tell you what side it is until I get there. One side will just give me an uncomfortable feeling and I have to move. I also don't like people sitting or being behind me, I feel like they are trying to scare me or grab me. I also twitch some. Not alot and only when I'm stressed, like angry or upset. My head will twitch a little. I know that I have restless leg syndrom so I was thinking maybe it could be part of that.

At 5'3"""", this is considered morbidly obese, and now that I am finally committed to doing something about it in an effort to improve my overall health, my doctor has prescribed this diet, which also limits salt and sugar, due to diabetes and high blood pressure running in my family.

I spoke with the 5 Dr.'s I work with and my family doctor before I started it, and they all said that it is safe, but to take multi-vit.'s because it is very hard to get all your food groups in your meals.  Exercise can be anything from just sitting in a chair and making circles with your legs and arms, to walking.  You can start out slow, that's no problem.  Don't overdo it, but do as much as you possibly can.  When you start to lose weight, you'll see how easy it is to get up and move around, therefore you can do more exercises.  Drink at least 8 8oz. glasses of water everyday, and fill up with fiber.  It helps you feel fuller longer.  This diet DOES get easier as you get on it, because your lifestyle changes, and you just get used to it.  Trust me, you can do it!  I wish you the best of luck with this.  After the first month, it will get easier and easier.  One thing with low-cal diets is that it lowers your metabolism, but the exercise actually keeps it up, so you kind of even it out.

My Doctor advised me to continue taking Insulin 30/70 through out my life. Most people are advising me that Insulin will affect the nerves in future and taking pills is enough. Now it is normal in urine and sugar and fluctuates now and then and not so serious.But my Doc strictly recommending me to take 20ml.insulin in the morning and 10ml. in the night and no pills. I am confused in this aspect whether i have to continue lifelong or not. Still i never failed to take injection everyday in the morn and night. Kindly guide me whether taking insulin continuously will spoil my life.,"There are two types of diabetes, they are called type 1 and type 2.
Type 1 diabetes is usually detected at an early age, my daughter was 9.  The pancreas makes the part of your blood that carries the sugar to the muscle.  When the pancreas stops making this, the muscle has to look somewhere else for sugar to make energy.  During this time, all the sugar that you eat stays in your blood  (this is what gives your the high numbers), also  when the muscle is getting is energy from other places it puts toxins into your blood which come out in the urine  (this is what gives you high ketone levels)

It is very important to follow what the doctor tells you!!! You need to write down every time you test your bood and what the sugar level was.  Normal blood sugar should not go above 140.  If the amount of insulin that you are taking is not keeping your blood sugar down, make an appointment with your doctor right away and have them change your dosage.  Never try to change the dosage yourself!!  

Your doctor may also referr you to a diabetic clinic.  These people work closely with monitoring insulin dosages as well as teaching good nutrition and meal planning.

Don't get discouraged, it can take time to get your insulin dosage set right for you.  It took my daughter a year and a half, which also included changing to all different types of insulin, different times of day for shots. You are not alone, there are so many wonderful people and support groups just waiting to help, all you have to do is ask.  (That goes for me too, if you ever need to talk, send me an email).

Getting back to the rest of your question:  
Only type 2 diabetes can be controlled by pills and diet. And last of all, and maybe most inportant;  taking insulin continuously can only SAVE your life.

If you want more detailed information about diabetes, search for American Diabetes on the web or ask your doctor.

422682,What is the correlation between low-income/poverty and obesity?,"I dont want to sound mean, but why are so many poor people or lower income people so FAT? Is it that they lack money to buy healthly foods or that they lack education about how to live a more healthy life? Does this lead to people believing that people are poor because they are lazy because it is easy to assume that fat people are lazy? Any idiot knows that being overweight is bad for you, so lacking the ivy league education is no excuse. And a plate of salad is just as available and cheap as a big mac, so it comes down to choice. If you look back in history, being fat was associated with WEALTH. Poor people were skinny and under nourished, royalty were fat and happy. Now this trend has reversed.....rich people somehow manage to stay skinny, and poor people get fatter by the moment. Whats going on?","Contrary to most people's opinion it's not the cost of food that's leads to high rates of obesity in low-income people.  It's the lack of education.  Most aren't educated about nutrition which leads to poor food choices.  If you go to your local supermarket and do a price comparison study (which I've done for a research project) you'll find that the cost of fruits, vegetables, whole wheat breads and pastas, and chicken are about equal to the cost of buying the ingredients to make some of these high calorie, low nutritious foods.

So, u know the questionnaires given during the 1st visit? Well, Iï¿½ve always had a hard time answering the questions involving loss of energy, loss of interest, ect,  bcause I have always had few/too many interests; have a difficult time making friends, or keeping them once I made them; turn down others invitations to events bcause I donï¿½t have energy to do them- even as a kid I hated spending time after school doing things bcause I much rather be at home or didnï¿½t want to be away from home so long.  

Once a therapist suggested Iï¿½d been depressed since childhood, but I quickly dismissed her. But recently Iï¿½ve been thinking she was right. So I guess my ? is: do u think Iï¿½m just lazy by nature, anti-social by nature, or was that therapist on to something and do u think itï¿½s possible Iï¿½ve had depression since childhood?","If a therapist doesn't find a label for you, they can't continue to treat you, or get paid. Although I often work closely with them, I also sometimes wonder why they constantly feel the need to ALWAYS find a diagnosis, instead of just saying, """"This person has a different personality than most other people. Nothing wrong with them. Just not the norm."""" So you're not the social butterfly.

Maybe you noticed these things since childhood because they are your personality, not because something's been 'wrong' with you since you were a child?

I think you're asking an excellent question. Unfortunately, in these times of 'everyone's got some psychological problem that needs treatment' you'll probably be hardpressed to find anyone willing to say it's just the way you are. 

A better question may be, are YOU, or can you be, happy with your life? Do you have activities that you enjoy, even if they're things you do alone? Are you depressed because you feel unhappy with your life, or are you unhappy because you feel you need to be 'like everyone else'? Sometimes I wonder that so many people are labeled depressed, etc., because NO ONE fits the current model of the norm.

3056956,Psoriasis and acne?,"I have horrible acne which returned after 15 years of being acne-free due to taking Accutane.  I am now using a Retin-A-type product once a day, a topical antibiotic once a day, and taking Minocycline twice a day.  I also had mild psoriasis on my scalp prior to the antibiotic regimen.  However, now, my psoriasis has gotten out of control.  I am using Aclovate on it, as it has spread to my face, and is pretty bad.  It is my understanding that yeast production and your body's immune system's response (or lack thereof) can cause psoriasis.  Am I causing the psoriasis to spread by taking and applying the antibiotics to prevent the acne?  Is it possible I have swapped the acne for psoriasis?  Would taking Accutane again be helpful, now that I'm 40?  Or would getting my hormones under control (I have no idea what kind of doctor to go to for that) fix it all?  My dermatologist is deaf to my pleas to take me off the antibiotics (I'm getting ready to swap dermatologists), by the way.","The meds you are on do not typically cause or worsen psoriasis.  The scalp/yeast disease is seborheic dermatitis.  Psoriasis is not related to yeast production.  Scalp psoriasis is tough, but you could talk to your dermatologist about a stronger steroid than aclovate such as betamethasone or clobetasol solution.  I would also consider dovonex solution.  If it is severe enough you could consider stronger medication such as methotrexate or injections (big potential side effects).

1887825,"Do I have an arrhythmia, nervous system problem?","Six weeks ago I had a tachy brought on by lack of sleep (50 hrs) and taking in tons of caffeine (1600mg in 12 hrs).  I have been to tons of doctors, cardiologists, oncologists and have been through tons of tests.  The only thing they have found so far is a slight mitral valve leak.  This could not be causing my heart rate to jump from 60-65 at rest to 100-110 as soon as I stand up.  My heart races with minimal physical exertion and all they found with all these tests was a slight valve leak?  I bought a $50 heart rate monitor and found the 40 to 50 beat jump on my own.  I have told every doctor I have seen about this before testing it on my own and none of them has been concerned about it.  They are telling me that I am in perfect health and do not have an arrhythmia.  Could I have messed up my nervous system?  When my heart started beating really fast I thought I was having a heart attack and panicked.  I have read that going through trauma like that can cause this.  Thoughts?","You mention that you have seen several doctors and had several tests, but have you been to a Electrophysiologist ? This is a cardiologist who only specializes in diseases and disorders relating to arithmia's.While there may be several causes to your symptoms sometimes the only way to find out difinitavly what may be causing these fluxuations in your heart rate are two tests,one is what they simply call a tilt table test.simply put they strap you down to a table (only so you won't fall) and they monitor your vitals laying completly flat and start to tilt the table both forward and backwards (as if they were tipping you up side down)this is often done when your sypmtoms are caused when you go from sitting to standing.this could be caused also by a sudden drop in blood pressure from standing,the other test is is a Electrophysiology (E.P. Study)
The procedure involves inserting a catheter  a narrow, flexible tube  attached to electricitymonitoring electrodes, into a blood vessel, often through a site in the groin or neck, and winding the catheter wire up into the heart. The journey from entry point to heart muscle is navigated by images created by a fluoroscope, an x-ray-like machine that provides continuous, live images of the catheter and heart muscle. Once the catheter reaches the heart, electrodes at its tip gather data and a variety of electrical measurements are made. These data pinpoint the location of the faulty electrical site. During this electrical mapping, the cardiac arrhythmia specialist, an electrophysiologist, may instigate, through pacing (the use of tiny electrical impulses), some of the very arrhythmias that are the crux of the problem. The events are safe, given the range of experts and resources close at hand and are necessary to ensure the precise location of the problematic tissue.

Once the damaged site or sites are confirmed, the specialist may administer different medications or electrical impulses to determine their ability to halt the arrhythmia and restore normal heart rhythm. Based on this data, as well as information garnered before the study, sometimes the specialist will proceed to place an implantable cardioverter device (ICD) or a pacemaker or will perform radiofrequency ablation. In any case, the information proves useful for diagnosis and treatment.

Throughout the procedure, the patient is sedated but awake and remains still. Patients rarely report pain, more often describing what they feel as discomfort. Some watch the procedure on monitors and occasionally ask questions. Others sleep. The procedure usually takes about two hours. The patient remains still for four to six hours afterward to ensure the entry point incision begins to heal properly. Once mobile again, patients may feel stiff and achy from lying still for hours. 

I have several arythmia disorders that i was born with and have been through these tests litterally over 50 times in my life,and while it may sound scary and painful it isn't ,you will receive sedation and pain medicine.Plus the info they can learn from these procedures in some instances can be life saving.Now i'm not saying you may have something life threatning.it may very well be something as simple as anxiety related but if it is bothersome enough that it scares you as much as it seems to i think i would see one of these doctors just to be on the safe side.","arrhythmia, nervous system problem",,,NA,,,,,When my heart started beating really fast I thought I was having a heart attack and panicked.,my heart started beating really fast,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,I have told every doctor I have seen about this before testing it on my own and none of them has been concerned about it.

4106109,HIV Seroconversion?,"I had a possible exposure to HIV 11 weeks ago this thursday. I had a test at 9 weeks and 3 days which came up negative. Obviously I will be having another test at the 12 week mark but just wondered about the following.
At 8 weeks I had acute tonsilitis. If this was a sign of HIV infection and seroconversion would this mean that my body would be making antibodies and that the test at 9.5 weeks should have picked it up. In other words can i assume that the tonsilitis was just that and not in fact a symptom of HIV infection.
I have read that normally signs of infection appear within 5 weeks of contact. is this true? 
Also does anyone know the percentage of those who show negative at 9.5 weeks but positive at 12? 
Am worrying myself stupid here so would be grateful for anyone who can put my mind at rest.

Many thanks","Ok, relax.  I'm going to lay it out for you.  If you had a test at 9 weeks, then I'm fairly confident you are negative.

The average time it takes for someone to develop detectable antibodies on an HIV Elisa test is 25 days.  94% of people have detectable antibodies after 56 days of infection.  97% of people have detectable antibodies after 90 days of infection.  The remaining 3% can take up to six months mainly because they have an immune system disorder (leukemia, etc.).

I volunteer at an HIV testing clinic.  I will tell you that everyone I have seen was detectable anywhere from 2 weeks to 8 weeks post exposure.  Make sure you are tested via a blood sample rather than oral specimen.  The blood test is slightly more accurate.  

You cannot diagnose HIV based on symptoms alone...you will drive yourself crazy.  A test at 9 weeks is a HUGE indicator that you are almost certainly negative.

Sounds like you probably have tonsillitis.  Get some antibiotics and you should be fine.

Just wondering if anyone has heard this or if this is the right course to go.  Not too many options though as my mom is without insurance and can't get any financial assistance.","I have copied the following text from the NCI website. This info applies the Stage 3 and 4 ovarian cancer. This is essentially the """"bible"""" when it comes to treating cancer. Carbo has been given alone as first line therapy and showed essentially the same overall and progression free survival as carbo/Taxol with less side effects.

Systemic chemotherapy

Since cisplatin was approved in 1979, first-line treatment of ovarian cancer has consisted of this drug being given intravenously or its second-generation analog, carboplatin, being given either alone or in combination with other drugs. Clinical response rates from these drugs regularly exceed 60%, and median time-to-recurrence usually exceeds 1 year in this subset of suboptimally debulked women. Trials by various cooperative groups in the subsequent two decades addressed issues of optimal dose-intensity [15-17] for both cisplatin and carboplatin,[18] schedule, [19] and the equivalent results obtained with either of these platinum drugs, usually in combination with cyclophosphamide.[20] With the introduction of the taxane paclitaxel in the early 1990s, two trials confirmed the superiority of cisplatin combined with paclitaxel to the previous standard of cisplatin plus cyclophosphamide; however, two trials that compared the agent with either cisplatin or carboplatin as a single agent failed to confirm such superiority in all outcome parameters (i.e., response, time-to-progression, and survival) 
Nevertheless, for patients with ovarian cancer, the combination of cisplatin or carboplatin and paclitaxel has been used as the initial treatment (defined as induction chemotherapy) for a number of reasons:

GOG-132 was regarded by many as showing that sequential treatment of cisplatin and paclitaxel was equivalent to the combination because many patients crossed over before progression; moreover, the cisplatin only arm was more toxic because it utilized a 100 mg/m2 dose.[21] 
The Medical Research Council (MRC)-ICON3 study, while having fewer early crossovers, could be interpreted similarly in regard to the impact on survival of sequential treatment.[22] 
Data from MRC-ICON4 have shown a survival advantage for patients treated with the combination treatment regimen versus those treated with single-agent carboplatin upon recurrence (see Table 2). 
In past trials, single-agent platinums were not superior to platinum combined with an alkylating agent; therefore, the explanation of a detrimental effect of cyclophosphamide is unlikely. 
Since the adoption of the platinum-plus-taxane combination as the standard nearly worldwide, clinical trials have demonstrated:

noninferiority for carboplatin plus paclitaxel versus cisplatin plus paclitaxel,[23-25] 
noninferiority for carboplatin plus paclitaxel versus carboplatin plus docetaxel,[26] and
no advantage, but increased toxic effects, by adding epirubicin to the carboplatin plus paclitaxel doublet.[27] 
A study started by the GOG with international collaboration, currently published in abstract form, compared the carboplatin-plus-paclitaxel standard to two carboplatin-containing sequential doublets (one with topotecan and one with gemcitabine) followed by carboplatin plus paclitaxel, and to two triplets including either pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or gemcitabine with the standard doublet. No differences have emerged.[28]

3760952,Heart attack; what are my chances of dieing of a heart attack when i grow up?,"im 16, my father past away feb. 23rd 2006 of a amssive heart attack and my grandma died of a massive heart attack, both on my dad's side...is there any chance i will also have a bad heart when i grow up? i already have medical problems...i have a sleep apnea, a spinal cord problem and many alergies to different things, but most of those don't matter, im just very afraid of having a bad heart....could someone help me possibly?","Dear Bobo:

I think it is very natural to feel worried about a heart attack if one's father has just died of one a couple of months ago. 

Here is my answer:

FIRST: You ARE worried; the question is, SHOULD you be worried? 

The answer is more difficult than just statistics. If you want statistics, cardiac risk, i.e. the risk of a heart attack can be easily calculated:

http://hp2010.nhlbihin.net/atpiii/calculator.asp

But as it states, this calculator, which is used nearly universally by physicians, applies only for those age 20 or greater. Why is that? Because the heart is like pump -- like any mechanical thing, be it one's car or one's sneakers, it wears out over time, and the older one is, the more likely one is have one's heart give out. Since 20 year olds rarely die of heart attacks (i.e. unless you do crack, etc), its not possible to calculate the odds for the """"average"""" 16 year old.

SECOND: What IS a heart attack? Generally, it implies a blockage of one of the arteries supplying blood to the heart. The heart, like any muscle, or any machine, requires fuel -- in this case, oxygen, which is supplied to it by the piping called coronary arteries. When these get plugged up, like any pipe, what is needed can't get through. When this happens to living tissue, the tissue dies. In the case of the heart, as it is the main (and only) pump supplying blood to the rest of the body, if the damage is servere enough, then the pump (i.e. heart) completely fails, the entire body is starved of oxygen, and one passes away.

What, then, makes one more likely to have a heart attack? Many things, such as genetics, i.e. a family history of heart disease. But, from this discription, anything that stresses or clogs the piping (arteries) to the heart -- i.e. causes heart disease, also known as atherosclerosis. Stuff like high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes (sugar in the piping, like sugar-water on the table, is sticky and gums up the works), high cholesterol, obesity (which is often a cause of SLEEP APNEA), all increase one's risk.

Generally, when a healthy 16 year old walks into a doctor's office asking, am i at risk for a heart attack, the physician will likely wonder why the patient is asking, rather than being worried about the patient actually being at risk.

Which brings me to YOUR question: """"could somebody help me?"""" 

-- the answer I think is: please, please consider talking to a counselor at your school; friends, siblings, a hotline, a doctor. You are worried about your mortality; And right after a family member has died, more so. It's natural, but often, it helps to talk about it. 

Go ask your doctor this question, and see what she or he has to say. It'll be worth it. As for heart disease, see your doctor regularly over the years, listen to their advice, and . . .

Keep well, keep healthy.

1921805,Borderline Personality Disorder Question?,"I suspect my partner has borderline personality disorder. He's finally agreed to see a professional about it so I want to make sure it's the right person.
Should he see a psychiatrist, psychologist or a counsellor? In my understanding, a psychiatrist can diagnose, use therapy and prescribe medication, whilst a psychologist can't prescribe medication.
The literature I've read about BPD indicates that medication is not always beneficial, that various forms of long term therapy in which the BP's relearn coping mechanisms and appropriate emotional responses is more appropriate.
Therefore, would a psychologist be sufficient? Money is an issue as he has recently lost his job again and I understand a psychiatrist is very expensive.
I have read other peoples questions and answers related to this. There seems to be a popular idea that we all have problems at times and that these people are often misdiagnosed. I am studying psychology(I've only just started) and I know this is real.
Advice?","This is a great question (or series of questions); and I think it's great that you are getting involved in improving your partners well being.  I've been diagnosed Bipolar/BPD and am under intensive psychotherapy and med management therapy as well.

BPD is a very complex and serious mental illness characterized by pervasive instability in mood, interpersonal relationships, self-image, identity, and behavior. This instability often disrupts family and work life, long-term planning, and the individual's sense of self.

I think you're on to something and reaching out at these boards is great.  However, we are all pop psychiatrists and none of us can diagnose your partner, so it's imperative that you pony up and have him see the doc ASAP and get a diagnosis so you can begin proper treatment. 

I understand the issue of funds, which was a similar issue I faced at the outset of my treatment.  It's often difficult for some poeple to rationalize the importance of mental health vs. physical health.  For example, if you found out your partner needed a certain surgical procedure, per the Dr's recommendation, where if delayed, came with fatal results, would you factor in the financial roadblocks?

As far as medication vs. non-medication approach.  Med Management should be at the forefront of the treatment for BPD where psychotherapy will exist as an adjunct treatment.  What's important to understand is that BPD is often co-morbid, where it will exist with another disorder; e.g. bipolar, ADD, unipolar depression, etc.  Understanding the patient is struggling in dealing with unstable moods, thoughts and emotions, your Dr. will be able to prescribe meds to bring your partner to a more stable mindset so they can go to the next phase of treatment an begin psychotherapy.  Specifically, mood stabilizers are extremely effective and will do wonders for your partner, relatively quickly.  

Through my experience, I tend to feel like I'm fighting in a war, battling in the trenches, where depression is my enemy, medication is my armour and weaponry and my psychologists are my commanding officers, providing strategy and tactics in guiding me through the field of battle.  All of those tools combined will help defeat the enemy and guide you to safety.

I've tried meds without therapy and vice versa;  I couldn't do it.  It's very difficult at first to put yourself through Psychotherapy, but over time, you'll find that it will build strength and a better sense of self if you put in the effort.

As for the meds, I saw a psychiatrist regularly at first after going through a combination of different meds/doses.  Over time, I've found the right med/dose and acheived stabliization in my moods,thoughts and actions, which has done wonders in my life both personally and professionally.

As for the psycotherapy; I attend regular CBT (cognitive behavior therapy) weekly and group therapy twice a week and attend other support groups as needed.  The combination of which have helped initiate motivation and change in combating my illness.  When someone lives with such an illness for a long period of time, they develop learned behaviors which are incredibly difficult to change.  The psychotherapy will give you the motivation to make yourself better and the ability to change certain problematic behaviors; which is a monumental task in itself, but it is certainly acheivable.

3566905,What should I do? I'm perfectly healthy all this time then all of a sudden...?,"I went to the doctor to see if there was something I could do about the fact that I bruise easy. I've always bruised easy, since I can remember, I'm just more concerned now that I'm older and people think that I'm abused. So I go to the doc and they do all kinds of blood work and then the doc said the nurse was concerned about my heart rate (46) so they did an EKG and sent me on my way and said they would send the results to me in a week or two. Yesterday I got a message on my answering machine, the doctor  had scheduled a echo cardio gram (heart ultrasound) for friday. The doc didn't even call me to tell me anything. I've been trying to call the doctors office all day and the receptionist keeps giving me the nurses voice mail. I never had any problems before. Why wouldn't they call before scheduling something like that or atleast tell me why. My Dad said not to go for the test until they tell me why they want to give it in the first place.","My personal opinion is I would go for the test and ask them then.  I would also continue to call.  Did you leave a message with the nurse?  I think if the doctor scheduled for this test it must be important and it would be silly to no go because he didn't call you personally.  If you don't like the way they are handling your case after the test, take the test results to another doctor and get a second opinion.  I hope it all turns out alright.  Good Luck!

Sometimes doctors forget there a faces beyond the tests they are looking at and don't always have the best bedside manner.  Unfortunately some of the best doctors out there seem to have the worst bed side manners. When you call express your concerns to the nurse they will usually listen to you and help you get the information you need.

Let us know how you are doing!

I am modifying because I saw someone say they think it looks like you have cancer which I think is a load of crap and people on here sometimes just want to scare others.  I hate it when people don't qualify their answers.  So here is some information that I found on the internet.

I am not fat but I am not in great shape anymore, if I were my heart rate would be even lower.  Your doctor is running test to see how you are, better to run too many than not enough.

1360556,hemorrhoids  and blood poisoning?,"Another weird question I can't find an answer for on any website:
A lot of people have hemorrhoids bad enough that they will bleed when they go to the bathroom. 
Now, this means that fecal matter passes by a wound, an opening in a vein. The fecal matter is alive with bacteria that can, if they get into your system, cause all kinds of conditions. Yet I have never heard of people getting sick. Wouldn't you expect something like blood poisoning to happen? Feces and open, bleeding wounds aren't supposed to mix well. 
I am obviously missing something here, but I just can't figure it out. Statistically, you just would have to expect people to infect themselves occasionally.","You make a very good point. One of the most common bacteria in the digestive tract is E. Coli. People get food poisoning from this, so logically a bleeding hemorrhoid or fissure should cause blood poisoning, but like you, I have never heard of this happening. I can only speculate as to why this is, but blood is nature's way of cleaning a wound. Perhaps since the hemorrhoid is actively bleeding during a bowel movement it keeps the wound clean and doesn't allow the bacteria to enter the blood vessel. Also the body is remarkably resilient and I would assume that if you had a tear or hemorrhoid, the bodies natural defenses would """"kick in"""" increasing the number of white blood cells to destroy any bacteria that did manage to get into the system.

2825139,Sinus Headaches & Root Canals?,"I have several questions.  First of all, I have really, really bad sinus'; everyone in my family does.  So, lately ( the past week or so ), I have been getting really bad sinus headaches.  I have recently had some dental work done ( 2 root canals and a temporary filling ) and I have noticed that whenever I get those really bad sinus headaches, it makes the whole left side ( the same side that I recently had a root canal and a temporary filling done ) of my face and jaw hurt; it doesn't necessarily make the tooth that had the root canal hurt or the tooth that was filled.  But definitely my face and jaw so it sometimes feels as if those two teeth are hurting...does that make sense?
 
Secondly, at my last dentist visit ( about a month and a half ago ), I had a root canal done and on another tooth, I had a cavity; not a deep cavity but a cavity.  So, after my dentist did the root canal, he put some medicine in the other tooth and sealed it up.  He said he wanted to watch that tooth to see if that one would have to have a root canal also.  My question is...how can you tell if it needs to have a root canal or not? It doesn't seem swollen or sensitive or anything like that...like I have been brushing it for awhile now and it doesn't hurt or anything like that.  How long after he put the medicine in can you tell if it should have a root canal or not?  What are the symptoms? 
 
Lastly and this is kind of embarrassing but...ever since I have begun dental work ( after 10 years or so of not going to the dentist ), I have noticed that I have begun to drool more than usual.  Now, I used to drool...does that have anything to do with it?  Does the recent dental work have anything to do with it? 
 
Thanks in advance!!","well  firstly coming to ur sinusitis problem : 

             as u have mentioned that sinusitis happens to b present among all ur family members , that might b the major cause for u  r sinusitis or any infections in ur nasal mucous membrane .

secondly coming to the relationship between sinusitis and ur root canal treated teeth , it's no ways linked in ur case , b'coz sinusitis as a result of dental origin occurs because if any infections or injudicious instrumentationperforating the sinus occuring or  carried out in the upper jaw and remember in ur case both r.c treated teeth are present in the  the right sided lower jaw and is simply impossible to have sinusitis because r,c treated lower teeth. 
 
more over ur sinusitis occurs on the left side , and ur jaw pains on left side and is simply b'coz u over load ur left side of ur jaw 


and lastly temporarily filled teeth , th infection may b very close to th pulp of teeth , in such instances we put calcium hydroxide dressing in the teeth allowing to form calcified tissue shielding the pulp from infection , if it happens there is no need for r.c.t , if calcifeid tissue fails to form after placement of medication and infection has reached the pulp then we do r.c.t

  symptoms of a patient to go for  r.c.t 

 severe sharp which gets excruciated up on taking cold and hot beverages , severe nocturnal pain , postural pain , th epain doesn't get relieved on medication and persists for longer time.

 there is no relation beween drooling of saliva and dental treatment , excessive drooling of saliva is a symptom of oral submucous fibrosis , facial palsy and rabies, nothing to get worried in ur case

All the experts - therapists, lawyers, priests - have all told us - especially her - that she has no grounds for a divorce and she is acting irrational.  Living in CA, a no-fault divorce state, nothing can stop her from disolving the marriage.  However, a mental disorder can stop her from getting any form of visitation or custody of the kids.  Not good for NPD.  Experts say it will be a bad backwards slide after the divorce for her. Experts are also agree that my kids will need therapy b/c of the negative impact NPD parents have on their kids and their psyche.  Any advice will help.","I think you summed it up with one phrase -- """"normal for her"""".  There isn't much you can do to get her to admit she has this disorder.  When coping with a person with narcissitic personality disorder, you are in an especially difficult situation!  My simple and quick advice to you would be to focus on your children.  They are at critical ages in their development and will need your consistency and your guidance.  They will need an adult role model to demonstrate empathy for the world around them.

1510808,Can eating healthy or drinking energy drinks reduce ADD/ADHD symptoms?,"Or having a good night's sleep?

From my own observations, it seems that I tend to be more focused and pay attention better after eating or doing certain things.
When I don't have a good night sleep I have difficulty hearing what people are saying, it's like my mind blocks them out intentionally for some reason.
If I don't eat right, I become self-absorbed and become less alert to the environment around me (bad for driving!).
If I don't drink an energy drink on a work day I am more prone to passive-aggression and holding grudges against others, and fail to be more openminded and see things from other peoples' point of view. I also have a harder time pleasing customers when I don't have an energy drink to give me the boost.

But is there any scientific reason why this is? Am I just off on everything?",I think eating less sugar and less artificial coloring and flavoring can reduce the problems associated with this disorder.

I seriously doubt you have cancer, but be sure to do a colon cleanse. You must remove the toxins in the body and if you dont have regular healthy bowel movements, that is what causes illness and disease because the toxins get into the blood stream. 

Educate yourself on cleansing and drink at least a gallon of distilled water a day. Be sure to also get more nutriton especially raw vegetables.

Best of health to you

Anyway, we just found out that he's recently had a heart attack.  (Mild, apparently.)  My husband and I eat very well.  The healthiest foods we can find.  We exercise regularly.  We try to encourage my father (we try to encourage all of our parents, actually) to do the same.  But, we just can't get him to cut out the half-gallon of ice cream that he can eat in one sitting.  He won't stop eating candy.  He can probably eat about 3 pounds of food at any one meal.  It's really quite gross.

I get slight stomach aches and headaches. My heart is beating so fast most of the time. Are there posibilities that i can be pregnant?","If you are having hetero sex there is ALWAYS the possibility of pregnancy.  

Take a deep breath and calm down.  You are still not late. A woman's hormonal cycle can vary widely, especially under duress.  Any recent stresses; change of diet, change of birth control method (chemical particularly), lack of rest, relationship issues, exercise, meds, diseases and so on can affect your body and that will reflect on your menses in different ways.  Heavier, lighter, early, late- you may even miss one!  So relax a little ;) 

The stick can give false answers, especially if it's too early or you are skipping a period.  Most manufacturers of those products suggest re-testing in 3 days.  hCG is a hormone that is measurable within about 10-14 days of conception with home products and most of the times the GYNs will rely on them. If you are still unsure you can get tested at a lab, a local women's clinic, your gyn office or health care provider.  Let your fingers do the walking across the local yellow pages.

254183,Care to share your coping methods for suicide/depression?,"I often feel suicidal and depressed. I know that during those times it's not death I want, but a change for the better in my life. I have 3 steady coping mechanisms I use mainly:
1. I allow myself 5 minutes to sob about my life and then I write a gratitude list.
2. I tell myself that I'll miss Desperate Housewives
3. I put on extremely loud and fast music and jump around to it.

It's those first 20 minutes of the blues that I usually need to get through, then I see how to fix my problem. However, these don't seem to be working as X-mas and New Year's draw near. So please share with me your best coping mechanism for when you are feeling depressed or suicidal. Thank you.","There are a number of things to try:
* If this has been going on for more than two weeks, see a doctor.  Medication can help.
* Confide in someone, hopefully someone older and wiser.
* The music and exercise do help, actually, it's been proven, but it will help more if you do it steadily, like 30 minutes a day.  Don't wait until you're depressed to do it.
* Call a friend
* Try volunteer work - it will give meaning to your life.  You can find it through www.volunteermatch.com or by putting in your zip code to www.pointsoflight.org.  If you work with people who really have it tough, you'll have an easier time counting your blessings.
* Especially volunteer on Christmas Day.  It makes the day go faster.  If you can't figure out what to do, visit a nursing home or a veterans hospital.  They can really use you, and people will appreciate it.
* Look up a poem called ""Resume"" by Dorothy Parker: it will make you laugh!  Or try any kind of humor, jokes or cartoons.
* You need to get out of your head and off your pity party - you can change your life, but you need to choose to do so.

I've had an upper & lower GI done (nothing wrong), it is not gas, constipation, or cramps.

Lifting heavy weights above the waist (standing military press or bicep curls).

what albuterol merely does is that it opens up your airway when you're having an asthma attack, but if you are constantly surrounded by these allergens, albuterol alone will not help. sounds like you need to be starting corticosteroids -- they help you tolerate the allergens that trigger the asthma attack but only a doctor will be able to prescribe that. try to learn more about corticosteroids and speak to your doctor if it would be a good way to go.

another option is to have yourself desensitized. my sister has a really bad case of asthma attacks when it comes to dust -- but dust is not something that we can avoid. she was also taking up steroids for it. it helped, but just a little -- hers was really a bad case of asthma. so we brought her to an allergy specialist. they did some tests to her to see where she is allergic most, and other allergens that she is allergic to. number 1 was dust, and pet dander was number 2. so the doctor started the therapy on her. every week she would come to his clinic, and the doctor would inject a (tolerable) allergen to her body, this would trigger her asthma of course so that's why every injection was followed by a nebulizer therapy. for 3 months, she did this -- every week, allergens are injected and as she became more immune to it, the dosage (allergen) increased as well, until she was able to tolerate it. it is very effective and so far she has not had any asthma attacks -- when it comes to dust, pet dander still triggers it. we did that about 6 years ago in our country, so i don't know if it is practiced here in this country.",asthma,,,,,,,,does anyone have like a miricle cure i wanna be able to go out soemewhere and not have to worry about and attack.,severe asthma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,help with asthma?,does anyone have like a miricle cure i wanna be able to go out soemewhere and not have to worry about and attack.,,,,No

As for your issues.  Maybe those lumps in your breast are actually breast development.  I can't remember how long the ""buds"" stage was supposed to last but... it sounds familiar. When you say that they feel small, sometimes larger and sometimes sore, have you noticed the soreness and size change around PMS time?  Maybe it's very normal.

Blood in your #2.  Is it a lot of blood?  You may have developed an ulcer from worrying yourself so much.  Blood in the stool is often a sign of ulcers.  You may also have simply BM issues and have irritated your um, bum.  There are tests that I think you can buy from any pharmacy (I think that you have to ask the pharmacist because they keep them at the counter) -- but there is a test you can buy to test your #2.  I think that you send a sample (like a dipped sample or smear sample) to a lab on the package and they can make basic, early colon cancer determinations.  Ask your local pharmacist.  

Throat cancer?  I don't know anything about this except that you should see a doctor.  I suspect that you have a touch of hypochondria going on here and that you may have psychosomatically given yourself some symptoms that are simply worry-symptoms.  For the cases of throat cancer that I've heard of, I think that the people were very heavy smokers. 

Because you have had cancer in your family, it is good and prudent to be aware of the genetic odds of it traveling in your genes.  However, I caution you about getting too worried about these issues without getting professional advice.  Mind over matter -- *think* yourself healthy and your body will respond.",cancer,12-17 years old,Female,,,,,,im scared,cancer,,,,,,,,,,,,,im 2 scared 2 go 2 the doctors,doctors,,,does anyone know how they test 4 cancer,,,,Yes: I know it's scary

1148707,give me your opinion on this matter?Its weird and it has bothered me for 3 years.I fgure it cant be heart?,"About three years ago I started waking up in middle of night and trying to catch my breath.I started having chest pains below my breast bone and around my heart.I went to doctor and he did gastrology test.Nothing.It continued around times that were stressful like arguing with co workers or other things.I went to hospital two times.They checked my xray and gall bladder nothing.Last year they checked my heart with stress test and the dye exam.Nothing!!!Well im relieved it isnt my heart but I cant figure it out.I have been on everything from nexium to prilosec.I just started taking blood pressure pills because it has gone up since this started.My symptoms include sweaty hands,heavy feeling around breast bone and chest, pain in lower back, light headed......could this be a panic attack.Ive seen 3 doctors so far and nothing.","Panic attacks often mimic heart attacks. That's why they can be so darn scary. But it's better to go to the hospital just to be sure. They would rather see you there with a panic attack than to have you second-guess and be wrong. Are you male or female? Often doctors don't take female symptoms as seriously because they think only men get heart disease. If you wake up in the middle of the night trying to catch your breath, you may have sleep apnea. That's when you stop breathing for several seconds and up to a minute. This can cause heart problems. So talk to your doctor about testing at a sleep clinic. (Do you snore?? That often accompanies sleep apnea.) I know it's frustrating to go to the doctor so often and to find nothing wrong. To learn more about panic attacks, go to the link below. You can also do a search on sleep apnea. If you think it could be panic attacks, there are medications you can take to control them... the SSRI class of medications. Talk to your doctor, or better, to a psychiatrist. That's a medical doctor with special training in emotional issues. They can diagnose conditions and prescribe appropriate medications. Good luck.

1496858,My boyfriends son suffers from depression and anxiety.?,"He NEVER has eaten fruits or vegetables doesn't drink juice and does not take any vitamin supplements. He is 9 years old. They want to treat him with medication but I believe it is caused by lack of the proper nutrients.  He always has stomachaches and does not want to go anywhere or do anything and has no friends. I have watched this develop for the past 4 years, getting worse by the day.  What advice can I offer.  I've tried to feed him fruits and veggies but he won't eat them.  He is also slow with his hand coordination and his speech sounds like a 4 year old.  What can I do.  This has affected everyone around him.  We are all stressed.  We have become prisoners to how HE feels.  What can we do?","try sneaking the fruits and vegetables into food he likes...pizza, spaghetti, jello, even icecream, give him foods that have a lot of vitamins in them, such as cereal and whole grain breads, since you are so concerned about his diet.
he also needs professional help.  it sounds like he is already receiving this, but, if not, he needs to talk to a therapist, even if his problems are nutritional.  after four years, it has probably developed into a more serious problem, and simply feeding him fruit won't fix everything.  now, i'm not endorsing the use of drugs, especially in someone so young, but they may be helpful if other treatments, such as counseling, diet & exercise changes, and behavioral therapy don't seem to work.  has he been diagnosed by a professional, or do you just think that he has depression and anxiety? he may have a learning disability, OCD, and/or social development problems, as well as the depression/anxiety. before treatment begins, he needs a definite diagnosis.  also, if he was diagnosed years ago, his problems may have changed or he may have developed new issues (this is fairly common).  find a psychiatrist that he and his father feel comfortable with, and follow their suggestions.  talk with a nutritionist and the boy's doctor about his diet, maybe they could explain to him how important eating healthy is, and what will happen if he doesn't, then tell him (and you) how to change eating habits.  set a good example for him, and offer healthy snacks after school.  it sounds like he does have a psychological problem, as well as a nutritional one, and he needs treatment for both.  make sure the therapist (find one that specializes in children) knows of your concerns about his diet, this is important information, and may dictate the proper treatment.

I recently went to a medical lab and they drew some blood from me for some tests. The thing that is worrying me is that I wasnt paying attention to the nurse when she got the needle so I dont know if she used a new or reused an old needle by mistake/

It can be a sign of mineral deficiency - especially magnesium, but also calcium and potassium.

3632063,I have a friend that has diabetes and he is having a really hard time today...?,"He measured his sugar today and it was 480...REALLy high.  Right now he is sitting at home chilling out, he took the day off of work.  He has the fans blowing directly on him and hes taken a few baths to cool himself down.  He takes medicine for his disease.  I am currently not able to go and take care of him because I am at work, and I won't be off until really late tonight.  Is there anything I can tell him to do to make him feel better?  Are there any foods he can eat to take his sugar down?","My step brother is diabetic as was my step father - who incidently died at age 38 years old due to complications from diabetes and his kidney transplant.

I'm not saying that to scare you -I'm saying it because when your sugar level swings up and down - 480, then 40, then 320, then 85..ALL the time - this does damage to the renal veins in the eys and kidneys.

He MUST not only get his sugar down (which can ONLY be brought down by the correct amount of insulin and NOT food or water - but by insulin prescribed in dosage amounts for him and his body weight.) but he has to CONTROL it.  It can NOT swing like that! Dangerous - can cause strokes, heart attacks, internal organ damages.

The question is - what did he eat that put him over the edge? Sweets? Alcohol? just even a big sandwich? does he have the flu? Alot of things can affect sugar.

He DOES need to call his doctor immediately and schedule an evaluation of diet and medication to see what the right combination is for him.

My step bro uses the insulin pump with great sucess -he's one that never took care of his sugar either -with it swinging up and down - now with the pump he is better managing his diabetes - althoug he still doesn't follow the correct diet that he should - and I'm not saying it is easy to do that. I have 10lbs to lose and I can't even do that right - its HARD!! But..its IMPORTANT and diabetics can live very healthy energetic lives and grow to old age if they work cooperatively with their doctor.

You also - MUST check on him -if his sugar is out of whack so that he's not passing out and no one finds him alone..My stepuncles wife (my stepaunt if you will) her brothers died within 2 months of each other. 34 and 37 years old - both had unregulated diabetes. Both were home ALONE and had bad reactions - and no one knew. it was horrifically sad.

Again I'm not saying this to upset you -but its a serious disease that needs to be monitored. Call your friend and have him get someone over there to sit with him.

And lastly - please forgive me for saying this - but his diabetic problems can not be something you make yourself sick over -HE HAS TO DO IT FOR HIMSELF. And yes - as his friend you should encourage that he get the help he needs. We all suffered so much guilt when my stepfather died - but know what? I miss him, I love him, he was amazing - but he did it to himself...he started smoking after his kidney transplant again...he didn't exercise, he didn't watch his diet - and we lost him- its been 11 years and I still cry.

please could someone help me on this 

serious answers only","Hi, if you feel you need a second opinion, then seek it. Did you know that antibiotics will run the natural immune system down if on them too long, I mean course after course after course. The body needs to fight certain infections for itself to be able to build a strong immune system.
A young child can be prone to chest infections if drinking lots of milk, cut back a little and give lots of fluids to help flush any infection through the body. You can get infant vitamin tablets maybe you should consider this and keep to recommended daily dosage as overdosing on vitamins can cause serious side effects.
Be sure to give your child a healthy balanced diet and not just junk. Lots of carrots and veggies and fruit. 
Don't give them too many bananas as they cause constipation in the very young. 
He does sound exceedingly tired but his weight loss could be growing into a boy from a baby, there is a hell of a change in the body form. I know as my son did the same as his baby legs become ladder legs....very tall and the taller they are going to be be the more likely they will suffer with growing pains.
Lots to consider before making a self diagnosis of Leukemia.
A growing child can have growing pains, a growing child can also be prone to ailments but their diet will help to make a difference as well as a good bedtime routine.
If your concerns or your childs health doesn't improve then DO get the second opinion. Better to be safe than sorry, but don't panic and think the worst, look at it from all angles especially the normality of a childs growth patterns. I have had seven to learn by and each are different but there was a pattern in the growing pains for the tall and at certain ages. Body changes as they grow which can be quite frightning for a parent who isn't aware of how fast they can change, height weight etc. Sometimes you see the weight loss but miss how tall they have become, understand?

Good luck, and I pray your child will get healthy soon.

Am I being paranoid or does this sound serious?","Dear Savitor!

Like a Man, let's see the matter straight from the front. First of all you did it right that you asked it rather than kept on guessing it. Its always better to ask than to guess. It is true that if any person have positive family history of heart disease there's a very high risk of acqiuring it at early age and these families are routinely counselled by family physicians, as a practice, to avoid all those known risk factors through which heart disease can manifest. What happens is, +ve family history creates such a genetic predisposition towards the heart disease that even at times moderate exposure can lead to signs and symptoms of heart disease. Hence, at times, it is better to over estimate all chest pains rather to guesstimate and stay home, understanding the fact that in all chest pains cardiac pain is the worst. I am surprized that your mother despite herself had experienced it had not taken you to doctor that very moment. U had experienced palpitations, and radiating chest pain, u have no other medical problems and suddenly you get these S/S with +ve family history, things should not be taken lightly. There's no harm in being paranoid about heart untill your heart disease is excluded otherwise.
Tell your parents to take you to the hospital for complete cardiac evaluation and risk assesment and rest of your siblings should also be followed for this. In this condition, one should not wait for any signs & symptoms to see the doctor, rather just go to hospital straight with the parents for evaluation and assessment. I might sound quite straight (might be sounding rude as well). But it is better to be objective. Honestly, its my honest friendly advise to u.  Please do not take it lightly and see a doc with your parents.",heart disease,25-34 years old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Am I being paranoid or does this sound serious?,heart disease,,,,,I am only 25yrs old,,,,Yes: There's no harm in being paranoid about heart untill your heart disease is excluded otherwise.

3672031,Tremendous pain in head and nerves while flying?,"Hi,

I feel heavy pain while I fly in plane. This happens especially when the plane starts landing. I feel the pain in the skull in the upper part of skull over eyes. The pain is unbearable and I feel tremendous pressure in my head and nerves start heavily stretching. I feel that the nerves in the head will blast. Please note that I feel heavy pain in the area near to eyes both sides of the face. This happens only at the time of landing and not the take-off. I am really worried of this situation and I am scared of flying now. I've felt this type of pain eight times of out of nine times I flied. Please provide some suggestion what kind of problem it could be. Please let me know if you have any idea about what kind of problem I may have or if any more details regarding to my problem.","Airplanes are pressurized, but they aren't pefect.  Pressure inside the plane probably drops just a hair below atmospheric pressure as the plane ascends, and once again increases back to atmospheric pressure as it descends.

Your head, especially the face, is full of air pockets called sinuses.  In addition to the sinuses that you see people complaining about in TV ads (i.e. the maxillary sinuses), there are the ethmoid sinuses, sphenoid sinuses, and frontal sinuses, plus others that I don't believe commmunicate with the external environment.  All of these sinuses are connected with the external environment via openings into your nose (you cannot see them, but an ENT physician deals with them all the time).  These openings allow the air pressure in the sinuses to equilibrate with the environment.  Furthermore, your middle ears are connected to the external environment via the Eustachian tubes which open into the nasopharynx.  Similarly, the pressure in the middle ear equilibrates with the pressure of the environment.

Sometimes, however, the openings of these sinuses in the nose can become obstructed for various reasons--infection being one of them.  Same situation with the Eustachain tubes.  I recall, as a child, having severe pain in my ears while on a plane.

This is where my knowledge is really lacking, but I'll give it a try.  I do know that middle ear infections are often very painful because of pressure accumilation due to obstructed Eustachian tubes (either obstructed or inflamed to the point where they no longer drain well into the nasopharynx).  Presumably the same applies to the sinuses in your face.  Inability to equilibrate with the environment, even if it's low pressure, may translate into pain.

You might want to ask your ENT about it, though.",pain in head and nerves,,,NA,,,,,I feel heavy pain while I fly in plane,pain,,,NA,NA,,,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,,Please let me know if you have any idea about what kind of problem,I am scared of flying now,,,,"Yes: You might want to ask your ENT about it, though."

ANOTHER OPTION TO CHECKING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR MONITOR IS TO TEST IT WITH A CONTROL SOLUTION.  ASK AT THE PHARMACY IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY.  IT USUALLY COMES WITH A NEW MONITOR.

IT COULD BE THAT YOUR READINGS AT HOME ARE ELEVATED DUE TO WHAT YOU ATE.  I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU ARE EATING HEALTHY, BUT IF YOU ATE SOMETHING WITH HIGH CARBS OR SUGAR, THAT COULD CAUSE THE HIGHER READING.  ALSO, STRESS IS A FACTOR.  IF YOU ARE STRESSED OUT OVER A POTENTIAL HIGH READING, THAT ALONE CAN MAKE IT READ HIGHER.  IF YOU ARE SLIGHTLY UNDER THE WEATHER, COLD LIKE SYMPTOMS, THAT TOO CAN ELEVATE THE BLOOD SUGAR.

4178159,How Do I Know If I Am Having Real Contractions?,"I am 38 weeks pregnant, 3 cm dilated, and inbetween 80% - 90% effaced as so my doctor said I could go into labor any time.

Meanwhile I have had discharge, sometimes clear and sometimes a mucus like color, following with major period like cramping that is uncomfortable in my lower abdomen vaginal area.

I am confused on what real contractions are and false ones because I only feel the vaginal cramping and some lower back pain along with tightening of my uterus. Could someone please help me out here? :) -this is my first-","Those all sound like very good signs! There is no such thing as ""false"" labor, every little squeeze you feel is a warm up for the main event! Just look... it already got you to 3cm dilated, woohoo!

The way to determine whether you are in progressing labor is a combination of how the contractions feel and how they behave. Progressing contractions:
- Come in a regular pattern, for example about every 10 minutes. They don't need to be ""to the second"" but they should be very consistant, such as: 10min, 11min, 10min, 9min, etc
- Are progressively longer. They should be at least 30 seconds long each and getting longer.
- Stay the same or get stronger with activity. So, if you go for a walk and they get more intense that is a good sign. If you watch a movie and they slow down, that means you probably still in the ""warm up"" stage.
- Get progressively stronger. The pain/pressure should get more intense as you go along. At some point you will not be able to walk or talk during a contraction and that is a VERY good sign!
- The pain of progressing contractions usually starts high in your abdomen and radiates down and around to your lower back. Non-progressing contractions are usually concentrated in your lower back or groin.

3964269,Does anyone have advice for a person considering a relationship with someone with Herpes HSV I II?,"I am having a difficult time getting comfortable with the fact that my girlfriend has HSV I and II(and I do not).  I am afraid, knowing that if I choose to stay in this relationship, I will eventually end up getting it as well...and there is no way to know how my body will react to the virus'.  Right now I am viewing the virus as a magnifying glass that makes small concerns seem like larger ones, because it is a huge commitment just to try to see if the relationship will be successful.  The relationship would already have more than normal amounts of stressors because of geographical issues(I'd have to move a long distance to be with her) and other reasons.  We have been doing the long-distance dating which is great, but distance makes the heart grow fonder as well.  I feel like a very bad person for having these feelings, but I'm trying to get a grasp on things, so please help if you have any insights.","I agree with the last answer but wanted to say one thing.  I was in a similar situation as you and knowing that my girlfiend had HSV 2 I decided to stay with her.   I used a condom for several months and never got it.  Recenlty we got engaged and have been having unprotected sex.  I now have the HSV 2 virus and to be honest with you, I really never ever think about it.  I honestly don't see what the big deal is. I get an OB maybe once very 3-4 months the size of a pea on my inner thigh....I put a bandaid on it, take medicine and it's gone in a couple of days.   It doesn't affect my life in any way and I feel like the luckiest person alive for having my fiance.  I would have done the same thing 1000 times over again.  So I guess the question you have to ask yourself is...  do you love her and can you see yourself being with her forever....if so,  I think the answer is very simple.  If not, but you think the relationship has potential to be something great then you just have to be careful.   The last thing I would do would be to not be with her because of this despite how you feel about her.      By the way,  you aren't a bad person for feeling this way.

Infantile eczema; Atopic eczema; Dermatitis - atopic 
Definition    Return to top 

Atopic dermatitis, commonly referred to as eczema, is a chronic skin disorder categorized by scaly and itching rashes. People with eczema often have a family history of allergic conditions like asthma, hay fever, or eczema.

Causes, incidence, and risk factors    Return to top 

Eczema is most common in infants, and at least half of those cases clear by age 3. In adults, it is generally a chronic or recurring condition.

A hypersensitivity reaction (similar to an allergy) occurs in the skin, causing chronic inflammation. The inflammation causes the skin to become itchy and scaly. Chronic irritation and scratching can cause the skin to thicken and become leathery-textured.

Exposure to environmental irritants can worsen symptoms, as can dryness of the skin, exposure to water, temperature changes, and stress.

Symptoms    Return to top 

Intense itching 
Blisters with oozing and crusting 
Skin redness or inflammation around the blisters 
Rash 
In children under 2 years old, skin lesions begin on the cheeks, elbows, or knees 
In adults, the rash more commonly involves the inside surfaces of the knees and elbows 
Dry, leathery skin areas 
More or less pigment than their normal skin tone (see skin, abnormally dark or light) 
Located commonly in the inner elbow or behind the knee 
May spread to the neck, hands, feet, eyelids, or behind the knee 
Raw areas of the skin -- from scratching 
Ear discharges/bleeding 
Signs and tests    Return to top 

Diagnosis is primarily based on the appearance of the skin and on personal and family history. The health care provider should examine the lesions to rule out other possible causes. A skin lesion biopsy may be performed, but is not always required to make the diagnosis.


Treatment    Return to top 

Consult your health care provider for a diagnosis of eczema because it can be difficult to differentiate from other skin disorders. Treatment should be guided by the health care provider.

Treatment may vary depending on the appearance (stage) of the lesions -- acute ""weeping"" lesions, dry scaly lesions, or chronic dry, thickened lesions are each treated differently.

Anything that aggravates the symptoms should be avoided whenever possible, including any food allergens and irritants such as wool and lanolin.

Dry skin often makes the condition worse. When washing or bathing, keep water contact as brief as possible and use less soap than usual. After bathing, it is important to trap the moisture in the skin by applying lubricating cream on the skin while it is damp. Temperature changes and stress may cause sweating and aggravate the condition.

Treatment of weeping lesions may include soothing moisturizers, mild soaps, or wet dressings.

Mild anti-itch lotions or topical corticosteroids (low potency) may soothe less severe or healing areas, or dry scaly lesions.

Chronic thickened areas may be treated with ointments or creams that contain tar compounds, corticosteroids (medium to very high potency), and ingredients that lubricate or soften the skin. Systemic corticosteroids may be prescribed to reduce inflammation in some severe cases.

The latest treatment for eczema is a class of skin medications called topical immunomodulators (TIMs). These medications are steroid-free. They include tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel). Studies have shown as high as an 80% success rate using these new medications.

I put this question in the ""Injury"" catagory, but I'm not sure if that was right!

Thanks so much... 10 points to the one who gets my sunburn gone!",You do not want to interfere with the peeling process. The skin that is coming off is dead and toxic to new skin. moisturize the new skin with something containing aloe or something like Vaseline intensive care. Take ibuprofen or tylenol for your pain. standard healing time will be 1 wk to 10 days. avoid direct sunlight until heeled.,peeling sunburn,,,,"I put a little bit on the burned area, and I was almost crying it hurt so bad.",sunburn pain,,,,,,,,,"I have used Banana Boat Aloe Gel, which provides temporary relief, but I just want the burn and the peel to go away!!",sunburn,,,,,,,,,,How to treat peeling sunburn?,"I have used Banana Boat Aloe Gel, which provides temporary relief, but I just want the burn and the peel to go away!!",,,,No
1368964,I'm havingsurgery on my legs. The surgeon will be stripping varicose veins. I'm still young but with poorgenes,"I'm a little apprehensive about my surgery. I know its minor with the vein-stripping, but i get bad thoughts about a mistake happening during the operation. The last one wasn't succesful, and it happened to be that i was one of the 5% that was unsuccesful as opposed to the %95 successrate. Is there anyway, if possible, that something tragic could happen that would result in leg amputation? Or would the doctor just have to be really incompetent, but my one surgery with him already went awry by not being successful. I just need some assurance. Could you help me?","There is more than one way to strip veins and without knowing which method was used the first time,I will do the best I can to answer your question the best I can.
Having worked in the OR as a Scrub Nurse,I have only helped do vein stripping in one particular method.
This requires an incision at the top of the leg and one at the bottom of it and I would think that it should have been sucessful as there is little that could go wrong EXCEPT for a vein breaking during the procedure thus possibly requiring additonal incisions.
If you have veins that are poor veins I suppose that it is possible that you are that 5% that will not be sucessful therefore I don't know if your second procedure would be anymore sucessful than the first.
Now if your surgeon did the procedure that I am familiar with the first time but is going to use another procedure on the other leg,there is the possiblility that it may be more sucessful.
If the second procedure is no more sucessful than the first,either way you are probably alittle better off than you were to begin with because the veins that were causing the problems to begin with have been either lessened.
You might want to visit another Dr and give him the information about your first surgery and seek his/her opinion about going through a second surgery.",stripping varicose veins,,,,,,,,I'm a little apprehensive,leg amputation,,,,,,,,,,,,,would the doctor just have to be really incompetent,doctor,,,I just need some assurance,,,,Yes: there is little that could go wrong EXCEPT for a vein breaking during the procedure thus possibly requiring additonal incisions.

Why?  Because this has very little to do with chemicals, it has everything to do with her coping skills.  It is one of psychology's biggest mysteries about how the brain function works.  When you become depressed for example, you begin to create a nerve dysfunction in the brain actually perpetuating the problem.  The symptons cause the probelm if that makes sense.  My point is that if she has never had coping skills, her thinking is always irrational and will cause the problems in her brain.  That's why without learning how to """"cope"""" she's not gonna be healthy.  Her biggest issue is that without someone, she will die.  A lot of peole fear this.  It's usually caused by neglect and/or abandonment as a child.  And as an adult, they can not comprehend that they will not die without someone there.

3836635,Treating ADD/ADHD without stimulants possible?,"My name is Brian and Iï¿½m 18 years old. I was diagnosed with ADHD about five years ago. I was placed on ritalin to treat my hyper-activity that was causing problems in school. The doctor changed my medicines for whatever reason I cannot remember to a drug known as 
Adderall XRï¿½ ï¿½ with that in mind, not once do I recall myself being dependant upon ritalin but ever since the changing in medicines, I feel like life has come to a stop. I usually take 3 times the dosages prescribed by my doctor and I am fully aware that I will be out of pills until the next refill. I canï¿½t seem to swing away from this! I KNOW I have an addiction problem, I canï¿½t force myself to tell the truth in the doctorï¿½s office. Adderall is also known as an AMPHETAMINE so for those of you wondering why itï¿½s this addictive, it falls right underneath meth addictions. I just want to life a normal life, how do I win this battle by starting when Iï¿½m sober? ...","Hi Brian,

My name is Sarah and I have a degree in psychology, keep in mind that I am not a doctor however.  

Anyway, I think what you are going through is very common.  The first question that I'm wondering is why your doctor switched your medication?  I know that you said that you cannot remember but it might help you to ask.  Also, it's good that you know that taking that amount of pills is not a good idea.  Have you told anyone else about this?  A friend or family member?  My advice would be to tell someone (or just let them read your post) and have them go to the doctor with you on your next appointment and that way the truth will come out.  You should really let someone know about this before it's too late.  

As far as battling your ADHD, I do not think that medication alone works in most cases.  You should also seek counseling.  The two coupled together have a very high success rate as opposed to one in absence of the other.  It's just like depression, you can treat it with medication but there is still an underlying problem that contributes to it and until that problem is solved it will continue to come back.

4322882,"What to do about stress, borderline depression, partly from school, mostly from nightmares...?","The last little while, i've been having these horrible vivid nightmares. I dream my husband leaves me, or that he's been cheating for a long time. And in the really bad ones, i dream that something horrible happens to him or my son, and they end up dying. All of these dreams leave me miserable during the day. Last night i had a dream that while my husband was watching my son, he got out of the house and was hit by a car. And I came home just in time to see the paramedics working on him. All i could do was go in the house and scream. They told me he would be ok, and then, sometime later they took him away in a body bag, saying there was a complication. It felt so real, ever since i got up I can't stop crying, I feel like i still want to just scream. I can barely help myself. I'm 25 weeks pregnant right now, my son is 18 months, and i'm afraid to sleep.I'm sure that by my reaction to this dream, i need to do something but what? I don't want the stress, and emotions to get out of hand.","Your depression doesn't sound very boderline - it sounds real.

The stress of taking care of your family, the pregnancy and whatever else going on in your life is taking its tole on your body, your mind and your baby.

The most important suggestion I have is to talk to your doctor. There are medications that are approved for use during pregnancy. But even if you don't want to take medication, just talking to your doctor can help. You could also see about getting a referal for a therapist who can help you talk through your stress and develop healthy ways for coping with it.

Other ways to deal with depression include confiding in a good friend, keeping a journal, focusing on something positive and sometimes even just sitting down and having a good cry.

What you are feeling is okay and understandable. But in order to continue caring for your family and to ensure the health of the baby you are carrying - I strongly urge you to see your doctor sooner rather than later.","stress, borderline depression",,Female,NA,,,,,"I can barely help myself.

3494971,I have had 4 miscarriages in a row in the past year...?,"I am 34.  I had my first son when I was 19, he is 15 now.  I had a miscarriage 4 years ago.  3 years ago I was diagnosed with diabetes...and I am well controlled.  I got pregnant 3 months after my diagnosis and delivered a healthy baby boy who is now 20 months old.
I have had 4 miscarriages in the past year.  As soon as I miss my period and get a positive test...hours later I miscarry.  It is horrible.  Can anyone tell me what in the world might be going on?  My progesterone was 13 this time and my doctor said she likes to see it at 20.  So I was on the suppsitories for a week and I did not bleed and was so happy.  Then I went to have my blood drawn and my HCG did not double not one time.
Last year I had to have methotrexate because the baby would not fully come out.  I really need some answers...it just doesn't make sense.","Chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs) are ubiquitous persistent substances that are incorporated into the body via ingestion, inhalation, and transcutaneously. Cell and animal studies have shown that CHCs are stored in different organs, especially the fatty tissue; exhibit hormonelike activity; and induce immunological changes (1-5). Miscarriages, fetal malformations, and growth retardation were observed in women with occupational exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbons or accidental CHC poisoning (6-10). 
In women with repeated miscarriages, intensive diagnostics allow the identification of a definite cause in some cases only, such as, for example, chromosomal, uterine, or hormonal disorders. In the majority of miscarriages, however, the cause remains unknown, so that discrete hormonal or immunological disorders are assumed. Therefore, further factors must be identified that may affect female fertility and play an etiological role in the pathogenesis of repeated miscarriages. In a previous cross-sectional study of an unselected group of 322 infertile women, increasing blood dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (DDE) levels were significantly associated with a decreasing conception rate and increasing pentachlorophenol (PCP) concentrations with an increasing miscarriage rate (11). 

We conducted this observational study to detect a possible etiological role of chlorinated hydrocarbons in the pathogenesis of repeated miscarriages. CHC levels of women with repeated miscarriages were compared with those of a reference population. Furthermore, women with primary versus secondary miscarriages, women with early versus late miscarriages, and women with hormonal or immunological disorders as causes of repeated miscarriages versus women with idiopathic repeated miscarriages were investigated in order to detect possible differences between these different types of repeated miscarriages. The working hypothesis was that an increased body burden of CHC may be an important etiological factor in repeated miscarriages. We therefore expected to detect increased CHC levels in women with repeated miscarriages in comparison to the reference population. We also investigated possible effects of low-level CHC exposure on hormonal and immunological parameters, which may also play an etiological role in repeated miscarriages. The long-term effects of CHC levels with respect to further conceptions and the outcome of pregnancies were also observed. We must stress, however, that this is an observational study conducted to detect possible associations and to create new working hypotheses for controlled studies. 


Material and Methods
Subjects. We determined CHC levels in addition to the usual diognostics in 89 women with a history of at least two miscarriages who attended the Clinic of Reproductive Endocrinology between 1989 and 1993. Miscarriages in women who had never delivered a baby are defined as primary miscarriages (n = 65). A history of miscarriages following the delivery of at least one baby with the same partner defines secondary miscarriages (n = 24). Sixty women complained of early miscarriages (by the 12th week of gestation), and 5 women complained of late miscarriages (13th-25th week of gestation). Twenty-four women had a history of both types. Thirty-nine percent of the women had a history of 2 miscarriages, 31% of 3, and 30% of 4 or more miscarriages, with a maximum 12 miscarriages. The median age of the women was 28 years (range 21-39 years), the median body mass index (BMI = body weight/height2) was 22 kg/m2 (range 17-37 kg/m2). Of these women, 87% were German. Non-Germans were mainly women from Eastern and Central Europe. All of them were Caucasian. Seventy-two percent of the women were employed, 15% were housewives, and 13% were industrial workers. Seventy percent of the women were nonsmokers, 18% smoked 1-10 cigarettes/day, 8% smoked 11-20 cigarettes/day, and 4% smoked more than 20 cigarettes/day.

The best thing to do (as it can take a while to diagnose CFS or M.E.) is to get as much sleep as you need and focus on getting to your classes. Cut back on any other stuff you do that doesn't need to be done. Until you get a diagnosis there is not a lot you can do. 

Also, the average person needs 8 hours sleep; some need more and others less. I can sleep 36 hours straight and 23 hours each day for weeks.

1367680,Has anyone heard of PTSD causing pain?,"2 years ago I was involved in a very serious car accident.  The accident was caused by someone else and was done on purpose.  I was a passanger in a jeep wrangler and the car that hit us was a ford f350.  I recieved some injuries, but now its been two years and some of those injuries have not healed, ie; i broke my ribs and they still hurt.  I have been to the doctor many, many times and they mostly think i am a headcase.  Today my doctor told me that she believes my pain is caused by ptsd.  This doesn't make a lot of sense to me, I agree that i do have some form of ptsd as i have reoccurenses and nightmares, as well as a huge fear of pick-up trucks, but could this really be the cause of my chronic pain? The doctor wants me to start taking zoloft, but i am concerned with its side effects.  Has anyone heard of ptsd causing pain? and does anyone know of alternative treatments or other drugs that can help treat this.  I want to be me again, not this silly lump of pain.","i would say yes.. because you are stressing.. causing yourself more pain... When people stress... u can get chest pains... and usually doctors will prescribe you medicine or tell you to breathe.....

Symptoms
PTSD is an emotional, sensual, psychological and physical disorder. Several or all of these may be displayed through symptoms.

A  person with PTSD usually cannot tell you ""I have PTSD"", unless they are already diagnosed and in therapy. It's not like having a cold or the flu, or a broken leg. The person may or may not remember the traumatic event. They may, in fact, outright deny that they are having any problem, other than the day to day stresses of the job, when in fact they feel inside that they are going crazy. Another difficulty with PTSD is there is generally a period of time that elapses between the trauma and when the behaviors start to show. With acute PTSD this is a much shorter time than with chronic PTSD, which can conceivably be years between the trauma and the fallout. 

What I've listed below are behaviors and symptoms I have seen others experience, and some I have experienced myself. This list is not all-inclusive, and, again, may be indications of something other than PTSD. If it is PTSD, they will exhibit more than one symptom from each of the three areas, though you may not see more than one or two.

A word of caution: a few of these behaviors are normal for police officers. It's when they go from ""normal"" to the extremes that they become abnormal. If you know the person, you know what's normal. Watch out for these changes.

Intrusion
extreme nightmares 
extreme paranoia 
sense of shortened future, impending doom 
Avoidance
loss of interest in sex 
depression 
isolation-especially from loved ones 
avoiding work: increased absenteeism 
avoiding certain previously visited locations that were favorites 
diminished interest in previously interesting activities, sports, people 
lack of motivation, constantly fatigued 
loss of Faith in God 
sleeping too much 
addictions: alcohol, drugs, sex (repeated affairs, or found with a prostitute) 
previously active in their work, significant shift to doing little or nothing 
weak work performance, quality of work drops significantly 
just plain numbing out 
stops exercise and previous self-care (poor hygiene) 
memory loss or poor recall 
disappears for periods of time from home or work 
Arousal
problems falling asleep, or problems staying asleep 
irritability 
worse than usual problems with Police Management and/or the public 
more than usual contempt/exasperation with supervision, peers, public 
increasingly cynical, maybe at most everything 
sudden outbursts of anger or rage, especially overkill for the situation at hand 
hypervigilance (paranoia) 
exaggerated startle response 
obsessive behavior (what is repressed is obsessed and acted out) 
compulsive behavior (shame can power compulsion, which can become addiction) 
overeating: noticeable weight gain 
anorexia: noticeable weight loss 
they were previously balanced in their work, or maybe even one of the best, but now it's insatiable, like a crusade 
more violence 
more hyperactive, and maybe now most all the time 
Somatic Problems
problems urinating 
frequent headaches 
chest pains 
intestinal pain 
diarrhea, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, blood in stool 
frequent, meaning very frequent, belching 
very high use of antacids 
Chances are you will see only a few of these things, not all of what is really going on. Some of these behaviors a person will outright hide, such as the addictions, for obvious reasons. These symptoms are a window to the soul. These symptoms are digressive, meaning over time they will probably get worse if not treated.

811059,Does anyone suffer with????,"I have had swelling in my lower legs, ankles, feet and toes along with my hands and fingers since March of this year.  I have gone to my family doctor and he never really said what kind of edema I have.  He put me on Lasix 10 mg's to take once every other day.  I've been doing that for months and increasing my water intake too. So far those areas I mentioned above are still swelled.  Not only am I swelled and uncomfortable, but the skin is a light red and shining.  I elevate my legs often thru the day, but nothing else helps.  I will be going back to my doctor at the end of this month.  At first it appeared to be pitting edema, but now it isn't.  Any help from anywhere would be appreciative.  Thank you.","This is called dependent edema.  Dependent edema affects those areas of the body that ""hang down"" or are dependent.  Lasix is the drug of choice for edema because it makes you pee a lot, but in doing so you pee out a lot of potassium which is very important for your heart.  This may be why the doctor decreased your dosage frequency.  Other ways to help the edema is to wear compression stockings which your doctor would prescribe for you.  You can also elevate your arms and legs at night, but this only helps to a very small degree.  One big thing is you do not want to increase your fluid intake.  What you do by increasing you fluid intake is you counteract the Lasix.  Right now you have more fluid in your system than your body can handle.  You don't want to stop drinking all together and if you are very active outside or you exercise a lot then you need more fluids, but you have too much fluid right now.  YOu should talk to your doctor about possibly restricting your fluids.  He or she can tell you what fluid intake is safe for your at the current time taking into consideration your daily activity level.

Could this be a reason why its hard for me to concieve? Also I thought it would be super easy for us since we are both in our early 20's and both healthy. I figured last time I had a pap which was about 6mnths back if there would have been any problems with me being able to concieve I would have been told then. Is this correct?

If it was a miscarriage, then you did successfully conceive.

I've been with the same sex partner for 7 years and were both very clean. i've tried canestine it helped the symptoms but took a while to go away but keeps comming back.. the discharge is a pinkish colour sometimes just white and thick it doesent have a fishy odour but sometimes it does smell weird its very itchy sometimes its not and it burns  its very irritating..I've been tested for everything i told the doctor about it my last pap test and nothing showed up and i would like to figure this out its been years and i would like to have a normal sex life :( please help if you know the answer!,"First of all I feel your pain, I used to have constant bacterial vaginosis and yeast infections during my teens however when I switched from commercial tampons and commercial pads to a silicone menstrual cup my infections stopped  from constant infections for 7 years to not a single infection in 3-4 years now. I looked into it more, also into more general menstrual and vaginal information to find out why this was a problem for me, and now I'm a menstrual activist and study gynaecology.


During menstruation you of course release menstrual blood into your vagina, this menstrual blood is a different pH to that of the naturally acidic environment of the vagina and as such the differing pH can affect the normal vaginal flora  thus also why you should not use anything but plain water to wash with, any sort of chemicals can interfere with that pH and lead to infections. The risk of infection during menstruation alone is not common unless you already have an imbalance in your vaginal pH, the change in pH from menstrual blood furthers the problem and menstrual blood is nutritious so bacteria love the stuff. 


Stop using tampons is my immediate thought, particularly commercial tampons such as Tampax, are the most harmful of all menstrual options, they prevent your vagina from cleaning itself, give bacteria a place to multiply, leave fibres within the vagina, put chemicals into the vagina that affect vaginal pH so in turn affect vaginal flora, dry out mucosa leading to vaginal splitting, and various other problems are caused from tampon use. This is why tampons are so strongly linked with vaginal infections and toxic shock syndrome, as well as other vaginal and menstrual health problems.

If you prefer internal menstrual options to external menstrual options such as pads or free-flow then I would highly suggest using a menstrual cup, these are cups that are either bell-shaped or diaphragm-shaped and made from medical grade silicone, rubber or plastic depending on the brand. Menstrual cups have no health risks associated what-so-ever and unlike tampons they are also hygienic, they can be left in safely for up to 12 hours without leaking or risk, they can be worn at night, worn while swimming, worn before your period is due and some even worn during penetrative sex. Menstrual cups are also cheaper, more environmentally friendly and more body positive than tampons, as well as most brand offering money back guarantees if you do not like them, very few women send their menstrual cups back.

If you would prefer to stay with tampons then I would advise you use safer options such as organic tampons, sponge tampons or homemade tampons, this is because unlike commercial tampons these are all made from natural materials so less likely to cause the sort of vaginal splitting you see from commercial tampons also these materials are less absorbent so minimise risks, unlike commercial tampons these other tampon options do not contain unnecessary chemicals.

3689869,Congestive Heart Failure Life Expectancy?,"What is the average life expectancy of someone who is in stage 3 of Congestive Heart Failure.  I have a friend who seems to not care.  He is a 47 year old male who drinks daily, smokes 1 pack of cigarettes a day and consumes a high sodium diet.  He has extreme fatigue, shortness of breath and nausea.  His back heart muscle has been diagnosed as extremely weak and he does not take his heart meds.  I'm concerned for his children and would like to know what to expect.","As someone who, like your friend, developed heart failure in middle age (I was 49 at the time), I can tell you that his life expectancy is directly related to how well he takes care of himself.  And that, of course, is bad news for your friend.

As you realize, he is doing everything wrong.  The shortness of breath would be relieved if he lost weight, gave up the cigarettes and dropped the sodium.  I don't know what medications he was prescribed, but probably at least one of them would help him shed the fluid that may be getting into his lungs and making it harder for him to breathe.  

It's no wonder he is always fatigued.  How would anyone feel if they have reduced heart function and reduced lung capacity?

As to his other meds, there are wonderful drugs now that can lighten the load on his heart and make it easier for the heart--the part that's still funtioning--to do its job.  If he doesn't take them, he is overstressing the working portion of his heart as it tries to do the job of the entire organ.  It can't, at least not without help.

The nausea is a very worrisome symptom.  That one suggests angina, which sometimes comes out that way.  His poor heart, overworked as it is, may be sending out distress signals which are perceived as nausea.  

Depending on how much alcohol his is consuming, daily drinking may or may not be a problem.  One or two drinks a day (NO MORE, and NO doubles) actually seems to benefit the heart.  But some people think that if one is okay, four must be great.  It's not.  The beneficial aspects of alcohol completely reverse if you have more than about 2 drinks (just one for a woman).

Overall, this man needs to go back to his doctor and lay all his cards on the table.  Could he be depressed and """"giving up""""?  That is very common with heart patients.  He needs to tell his doctor *everything* he is doing and not doing, and why.

I believe that patients have rights, and so does your friend.  But he also has children, which means he has a responsibility to be around for them until they are well established on their own.  If he lets himself die while they are still young, they will never fully forgive him.  What's worse, he will have missed out on seeing them grow up, which one of the best parts of life.

The last test (ANA) is anti-nuclear antibody.  It is generally used to test for autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, commonly known as SLE or lupus.  A positive test is suggestive of the disease.  This disease is characterised by the butterfly rash over the face.  But as it's name suggests, it is a systemic disease affecting many organs.  Other blood tests for SLE may include anti-rho antibody, anti- dsDNA antibody (anti double stranded DNA antibody), C3 and C4 (complement 3 and complement 4) levels.  The diagnosis of SLE, however, is mainly clinical.  The American Rheumatology Association has a criteria for diagnosing SLE, you'll need to fulfil 4 out of the 11 criteria to be diagnosed with SLE.  Do a search on yahoo and there'll be plenty of sites with links to the criteria.

I am pretty sure you would know if it were a kidney stone, because it doesn't just go away in a day, either (personal experience)  plus you would have notice some blood in urine.

It still could have been your appendix.  You won't get the fever until it ruptures.  Acute Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix, your body is always getting inflammation, and it can get rid of it.  Your body might have done just that.  If you didn't have it removed, which sounds like your didn't.  You still could do it again.  If it happens over and over in your life.  It's called chronic appendicitis.  This usually doesn't happen, because the ER doctors usually take it out, just in case.  If it ruptures, the contents of your intestines with all its germs get into your abdominal cavity causing a massive infection that could kill you.  And, if it doesn't because you made it to the hospital soon enough, it's a mess to clean out.  So, better safe than sorry in their opinion and just remove it.

The websites the first answerer gave you are good resources. You will find that rather than different stages, there are actually different types of MS.  Some come and go, some deteriorate.  Depending on the type your brother has, there are different expectations, including difficulty walking, talking, cognitive changes, etc.  Its a tough disease, especially since the patients are generally so young.  Your brother is lucky to have a sister like you who cares so much.  Staying on his meds, and staying out of the heat are two important factors.  There is good rehabilitation available and he should consider that in order to preserve and maintain functioning for as long as possible.

Nothing works!","First the important thing is to talk to your doctor.

Next, don't take laxatives because your intestines (smooth involuntary muscle) will learn to rely on them.

It is important to increase your fiber intake - soluble and insoluble.  Soluble fiber (like the white/yellow part of an apple) makes your stool soft, and insoluble fiber (the apple peel) irritates the intestines and stimulates movement (peristalsis).

There are fiber supplements - if you intend to use those be certain to take enough water, otherwise that too can contribute to an obstruction.  There are bran cereals that are easy to eat - for example all bran has half a day's fiber in 1/3 cup of cereal.  Sprinkle that on a salad instead of bacon bits, mix it into muffins for extra fiber...etc.  Increase your intake of vegetables too.

You could end up with a nasty bout of diverticulosis which may also land you in surgery, and you only have so much bowel that can be removed.  You could also end up with a colostomy bag.

1145364,Is anyone scared that advances in medicine will make humans weaker in the long run?,"When a person before the age of """"modern medicine"""" say 1900 or so had a terminal illness, natural selection and the absense of a cure would cause that particular person to die prematurely, in which case, they could not pass their defect or disease on to any offspring (if they didn't have any yet).

Now, medicine has evolved to where we are keeping people with serious diseases such as depression, diabetes, asthma, etc alive with drugs.

This hits on a personal note because I have serious asthma and probably would have died before the age of 5 if there wasn't today's medicine. Now I am worried about passing that on to any children I might have, and I'm considering not having any due to this and some other conditions I have, such as degenerated discs in my back at the age of 15.

My feeling is that the reason health care costs are astronomical is because each person has more problems today because we aren't weeding out the weak or defective.

Opinions?","if the theory of evolution holds, it's not humans who are getting weaker but the viruses are getting stronger. for each remedy we conjure or every treament we find, it may cure the ailment then, but eventually, stronger viruses evolve to overcome the treatments and drugs.

436504,Young IBS?,"My 11-year old daughter has been experiancing some constipation and problems with her bowel movements for the past few months. I've taken her to the doctor, because it sounds like she's inherited my IBS. The doctor said that it's too early to diagnose IBS, but to give her this stuff called 'Mirilax' which seems to be doing okay. My question is, is it possible she's inherited my IBS, or should I just ignore my worry?","It is not too early to diagnose IBS in your daughter and I think you're probably right.  The Mirilax will only help with elimination and not get to root of problem I'm sure you realize.  

There appears to be four main causes of IBS: stress, insufficient intake of dietary fiber, food allergies, and meals too high in sugar. Stress increases the motility (the rhythmic contractions of the intestine that propel food through the digestive tract) of the colon and leads to abdominal pain and irregular bowel functions.

Dietary fiber promotes proper colon function. Patients with constipation are much more likely to respond to dietary fiber than those with diarrhea. Increasing intake of dietary fiber from fruit and vegetable sources rather than cereal sources may offer more benefit to some individuals.

Food allergy as a cause of IBS has been recognized since the early 1900s. More recent studies have shown the majority of patients with IBS (approximately two-thirds) have at least one food allergy, and some have multiple allergies. The most common allergens are dairy products (forty to forty-four percent) and grains (forty to sixty percent). Many patients have noted marked clinical improvement when using elimination diets (see FOOD ALLERGY for further discussion).

Meals high in refined sugar can contribute to IBS by decreasing intestinal motility. When blood sugar levels rise too rapidly, the normal rhythmic contractions of the gastrointestinal tract slow down and in some portions stop altogether. A diet high in refined sugar may be the most important contributing factor to IBS being such a common condition in the United States.

What nutritional supplements should I take for Irritable Bowel Syndrome?

Foundation Supplements. There are three products from Natural Factors that I think are critical in supporting good health:

    * MultiStart (age and gender specific multiple vitamin and mineral formulas). Follow label instructions.
    * Enriching Greens - a great tasting """"greens drink"""" containing highly concentrated """"greens"""" like chlorella, spirulina, wheat grass juice, barley grass juice, etc., and herbal extracts. Take one serving (one tablespoon) in 8 ounces of water daily.
    * RxOmega-3 Factors - A true pharmaceutical grade fish oil supplement. Take two capsules daily.

PGX with Mulberry Extract from Natural Factors. PGX is a special soluble fiber blend that is primarily used to help control after meal elevations in blood sugar. However, it is extremely useful as well as a gastrointestinal tract tonic in patients with IBS. Take 2-4 capsules 5 to 15 minutes before meals.

RevitalX is a high potency multi-nutrient powdered drink mix formula from Natural Factors. The product was developed by Michael Lyon, M.D., and specifically engineered to be an excellent source of important nutrients to support the gastrointestinal lining and aid detoxification. It is an excellent source of hypoallergenic vegetarian protein that we have termed GoldPeptides along with specific nutritional, probiotic, and herbal support to the digestive system. Take one serving daily.

Peppermint Oil Complex with Oregano Oil from Natural Factors provides volatile oils from peppermint, oregano, and caraway seed oil in an enteric-coated capsule so that it does not break down in the stomach but is instead delivered to the small and large intestine. Preparations containing peppermint oil in enteric-coated capsules have been shown to be very effective in IBS. Take one or two capsules three times daily twenty minutes before meals.

Probiotic supplements supplying Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteria species are very important in IBS. Take a product that will provide 5-10 billion live bacteria daily. We have gotten a great deal of positive feedback on BB536 a special Bifidobacteria in the RevitalX Probiotic with BB536 from Natural Factors.

Monday in my computer class it happened aagain but worse. so i went to my school nurse and she gave me tums thinkin it was heartburn, it wasnt, so she checked my heartbeat and noticed it was irregular.

1518012,could my girlfriend be pregnant???,"my girlfriend is showing some signs like nausea, tired, back aches, headaches, and she has little bumps on her breast, not on the nipple but under the nipple on that brown circle area(dont know what its called) and she gets hungry more. I dont know what to think. her period is due June 15. she doesn't want to go to the doctors until after her period is due. and its been a week since she ovulated. Please help","The little bumps are caused by hormonal changes in a womans body.  Usually a woman get them when she is pregant.  It is a very early sign of pregancy.  

All the other signs/symptoms that you are saying that she has, are also early signs of pregancy, but they could just be early signs of a period as well.  Right now, its way to early to tell if she could be pregant UNLESS you both think there is a chance that she could have gotten pregnant on her last cycle.  Remember, it IS possible to have a period and be pregnant.  How was her last period?  Was it shorter than usual?  Less blood flow?  Just some spotting?  If so, there is a chance that she got pregnant in her last cycle and if that is the case, I would recommend that she take a pregnancy test ASAP!  

If not, then she needs to wait until atleast 4-5 days BEFORE her next period starts and take a first responce.  That pregnancy test can  detect the lowest amount of HCG (the pregnancy hormone) in a womans body.  If she gets a negitive wait a few days and retest, this is because the HCG level double every 48 hours resulting in a positive pregnancy test.  
 
Chances are, yes she is PG.  However I am not a doctor and I can not say for sure.  If it turns out that she is not, she needs to get to a doctor asap to get the bumps checked out.

Herbal remedies and supplements are not guaranteed to work, and in some cases can do more harm than good.

ED can be caused by many many thigs including (but not limited to) stress, substance abuse, depression, age, weight gain/weight loss, diet, etc.. I think that it is important to look at these factors because there is a chance that you may not need medication. It may be something as simple as a small change in your lifestyle. In any case, I urge you to really do your homework and explore all avenues. Medications are not always the answer.

3371147,How can I help my boyfriend lose weight?,"My boyfriend is 5'10 and very near 300 lbs. We were recently told that he has signs of diabetes, he always has heartburn, very low self-esteem, but he is the sweetest man you will ever meet. The thing is that it's very hard to get him movtivated not the first week or the second but as time goes by he loses interest in trying to change his eating habits, he feels that everything is against him. He works outside from 6am - 7pm, there is no way to prepare his foods at lunch or eat in between due to his job so he usually takes just a sandwich & chips for lunch, by the time he gets home he's starved and I feel it's hard to control portions. The only exercise we can do together is walk, but it doesn't seem to be enough. In high school he tore his ACL, broke his wrist and fractured his ankles. The local pool is closed on the weekends which is the only time he has off and seemed to be my last option. I love him so much and I know he really wants to change but what other options are there?","I once dated a very obese man, and wondered this myself.  In the end, I realized that he did not want to change.  There was nothing I could do for him, he had to want to do it himself.  We ended up breaking up, because he refused to do anything to change his unhealthy habits and that is not how I wished to live my life.  Hopefully, your boyfriend really wants to change his lifestyle not just to please you, but for his own health and well being.  In the end, if he doesn't really want to do it for himself, then nothing you do will help him.

That being said, there are some things you can do.  Number one, of course, is to be very supportive of him.  He will have bad days now and then, and you both have to work through it.

The best place to start is to look at his current routine and pick a few small changes at a time so the change is not too drastic.  This is not a temporary diet, but a lifestyle he should be able to really live with in the long run.

Does he eat breakfast?  Studies have shown that people who eat breakfast are able to lose weight and keep it off.  I recommend a low calorie/high fiber/high protein/low sugar cereal with skim milk.  I like cinnamon shredded wheat or quaker oatmeal squares.  Also include some fruit, like a banana.

For lunch, he currently eats a sandwich and chips?  Does he bring it or buy it from a place like Togos or Subway?  Either way, can he switch to wheat bread instead of white?  Switching to low fat mayo or using mustard instead will save a lot of calories.  Also, skip the cheese.  Turkey is a good lean source of protein, but lean ham or roast beef isn't all that bad.  Just stay away from meatballs or balogna or other fatty deli meats.  Also, put more veggies on it, like lettuce, tomato, and other things.  Instead of chips, could he have an apple or something like that?  At least choose a lower fat variety of chips, such as sunchips or those Baked potato chips.

If he is starved when he gets home, then I'd say he needs to have a snack in the afternoon.  Ideally, something with protein.  Maybe he could bring a protein bar to work?  There are a bunch of good ones out there by South Beach Diet, SlimFast, and Special K has a new protein bar as well.

For dinner, try fixing some grilled chicken, veggies, and brown rice or something similar.  It needs to contain lean protein, some kind of veggies (ask him which are his favorites so he'll actually eat them), and a complex carbohydrate with lots of fiber.  Also, drinking water instead of soda will make a HUGE difference.

As for the walking, I would say that's an excellent start.  It's something you can do together and get into the habit of daily exercise.  If he has injuries, it might not be a good idea to push him too much too soon.  Maybe try to increase the speed or duration of the walks a little every week.  You might try signing up to walk a 5K race in the spring, so he has a goal in mind to work towards.  Consult a doctor before you do anything too strenuous though.",lose weight,,,NA,"The thing is that it's very hard to get him movtivated not the first week or the second but as time goes by he loses interest in trying to change his eating habits, he feels that everything is against him.",boyfriend lose weight,,,,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,,,,what other options are there?,"The thing is that it's very hard to get him movtivated not the first week or the second but as time goes by he loses interest in trying to change his eating habits, he feels that everything is against him.",,,,"Yes: Hopefully, your boyfriend really wants to change his lifestyle not just to please you, but for his own health and well being.

1446125,"The way this world works, will diabetes ever be cured?","From Wikipedia:
Exubera, inhalable insulin developed by Pfizer, was approved for use in 1-2006. In 4-2006, the UK's NIH advised against the use of inhalable insulin on the grounds that avoiding injections did not justify the higher cost of the new product, estimated at ï¿½1100 per year. The NIH recommended in 6-2006 that diabetics should use Exubera only if they could establish 1) a medically proven fear of insulin injections or 2) chronic problems with their insulin injection sites.

Novo Nordisk, filed a lawsuit against Pfizer on 8-2006, claiming patent infringement, seeking both compensatory damages and injunctive relief. Novo sought an injunction preventing the release of Pfizer's 9-2006 launch of Exubera. A federal judge delayed a decision on Novo Nordisk's request for injunctive relief until 12-2006 court hearing. Pfizer's answer contends Novo wants to deny diabetics access to Exubera because it's the only FDA approved inhalable insulin & would hurt Novo Nordisk's business.","When was the last time any big moneymaking disease was cured?

Please help me","There will be a needle, but probably only one, to start an IV. An IV needle hurts less than a shot, because it doesn't go into the muscle, jut the skin and blood vessel.

If you are this frightened, make sure your docs, nurses and anesthesiologist all know. They can give you something to help or help you understand what's going to happen. A calm patient usually heals better than a terrified one, so they will help.

Most general anesthesia is given--at least the part that you will actually experience--in the IV. They usually tell you to count backwards from ten. Few people get to six before they're asleep. It actually feels VERY nice, like happy, dizzy, and passing out, kinda like some illegal drugs. But it lasts only a few seconds, so don't worry.

4382088,Ovarian Laparoscopy?,"I was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries, and after a year, the cysts have not gone away.  My gynecologist said that if the cysts still do not go away by the time of my next visit (six months), we should seriously consider laparoscopy.  
I'm confused about an ovarian laparoscopy.  The way it was explained to me, I think my doctor just wanted to look.  I read online that laparoscopy is used just to see.  However, I have also read that if an abnormality is seen, such as a cyst, the doctor will drain them.  Also, is this what is called """"ovarian drilling""""?  I heard that if I develop scar tissue, I will not be able to get pregnant.  What are the chances that I will be scarred?  Lastly, would this be for both ovaries?  
Thank you.","Polycysitic ovaries, or PCOS is a complex condition that to this day has no clear cut situations. But first as off let me address your possibilities of not being able to fall pregnant. This is not always the case. Your presonal situation will be different to every other woman with PSOC, so this is something only you and your doctor can discuss, however, more and more women who suffer from PCOS are falling pregnant. If you are in a relationship and are looking ot fall pregnant, then there are many things medically that can be done to assist, however some women dont need assistance at all.

Secondly, a Laparoscopy is a procedure that uses a """"laparoscope"""" via a key hole inscision to send a camera to your ovaries to have a look.  Your Doctor may or may not remove cysts that he sees, as depending of the size and the nature of the cyst, they can often disappear over time. If he does chose to remove the cyst, it generally can be done through the same key hole inscision. 

Also, ovarian drilling, done during laparoscopy, is a procedure in which a laser fibre or electrosurgical needle punctures the ovary 4 to 10 times. This treatment results in a dramatic lowering of male hormones within days and is often performed in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome. Studies have shown that up to 80 percent of patients will benefit from such treatment.

One thing I wish to say to you is never follow 'things you have heard' as gospel for your own health. Only a health professional who knows your medical history should make calls on your personal situation. 

But I do suggest that you read health journals, or even go to www.soulcysters.com It is a support group for women with PCOS and can be a valuable resource for information.

His daughter suspects liver cancer but is waiting on the cancer specialist to confirm. What can I expect? Is he going to die soon? Is there any possibilities his condition is manageable for a certain amount of time? How long? Please no rude and cold-hearted, or sarcastic remarks and answers. With my respect.","Liver disease can be a very difficult problem to deal with for people. As long as you stay in touch with his doctors and get him all the services and care he needs, you will ensure that his condition is optimized. 

Your father has Cirrhosis. This is a chronic liver diseases (usually due to Hepatitis) where the normal liver cells are damaged and replaced by scar tissue. Basically, the amount of normal liver tissue is decreased. Liver disease is common in the US (ranked 8th as a cause of death in the United States).

Your dad's Gastroenterologist would make this diagnosis and it sounds like he is getting worked up for Cirrhosis. Without knowimg more details about him it may be hard to say but it seems unlikely that he has cancer. 
Cancer of the liver is usually diagnosed by imaging, clinical picture and labwork (serum AFP). The most common (primary) malignancy of the liver is hepatocellular carcinoma. The only treatment is liver transplant. However, this surgery is very complicated. 

You can help your father by watching his SALT intake, making sure he takes his medications and that he gets to his appointments. (Develope a close relationship with his Gastroenterologist/ Hepatologist.)

not so quickly (?) But Midwifes  don't use epid. as much as a OBGYN does (right?)  I 'd like to know that there's an option of pain relief in the form of medicine, since I was in a lot of pain with my 1st / 2nd and want to be prepared if the 3rd is the same. With my 1st 2 children I had the epid. once I had dilated  to 7. My  Dr. said that if I had  meds. before then the labor might be slowed down, thus might end with a  C-section. 
What do you think? It's been 10 yrs. since I've been  preg. so this is like the 1st time. 
Thanks in advance!","I used a midwife that was in a practice with a OB/GYN and she was WONDERFUL!  I hope and pray that she's around for every single one of my future pregnancies!  The only thing you may have to worry about is your age.  Since you're 40 (not that that's old!) you're more at risk for certain things, and although a midwife will most likely treat you, she may want to work close with a OB/GYN in case of complications.  Also, about the whole epidural thing - my midwife never once mentioned trying to make it through labor without drugs.  She encouraged me to get them if I wanted them.  It was all up to me.  She never discouraged me from having the epidural done.  As for c-sections - I think it's really a case by case thing.  I doubt a midwife is going to let you go without a c-section if you really need one.  If you're really worried about the choice that you're making, do some research and set up a few appts. to speak with some midwives.  They'll be able to answer your questions and reassure you, and I'm sure you'll feel much better about your choice once you have all of the facts.  Congratulations on your pregnancy!!!

It's much healthier to commit to a support group. I'm sure there are hotlines you can call for the nearest group that meets in your area.  Check those out.  

You may want to include some form of physical activity into your daily schedule, even if some days you will not carry them out.  Reward yourself when you do with something you like.

Think of some of your positive qualities.  Write them down and stick them in places you can see to read back to yourself, then run them thruough your mind a few times a day, even if you dont feel like it.  You need reprogramming while depressing.

Be selective about tv, stay away from news and others (eg, comedy sitcoms, talk shows, spy movies, ....), music, and be aware of other environmental noise elements so you can either avoid them or else minimise the effects.  Just as well, the Internet is not always so wholesome to be in (info overload).  Whatever it is, you need to examine your immediate environment and remove/minimise anything that bothers you a lot.  

When you find yourself analysing stuff too much, find something else to do.  Change the way you walk home from work/school, take a dif route, even if it's longer.  You need to get out from the routine of doing things.  Modify your diet a little.  

These are just some ways you may reduce the effects of outward routine, so your mind may find dif channels to park in.  Nothing ever changes overnight.  Be patient with yourself and with others.  Laugh a little, cartoons are great for that.

Dec 04 I was diagnosed with a 43 lb ovarian tumour on one of my ovaries, surgery removed the tumour as well as half of my ovary.

My legs are absolutely killing me. They ache and cramp.
Where my uterus is located is very firm and is enlarged, it pulses from time to time and feels as though it's cramping (my period is due on or around the 27th).
I feel exhausted, I can sleep for well over 12 hours, I feel drained - this is one of the symptoms I had last year too.

And I often feel weak.  She told me if I don't exercise I would turn to be diabetes.  So what should I do if I keep feeling dizzy and how can i exercise if I keep feeling this way.

Thanks","reactive hypoglycemia means that your blood sugar changes throughout the day for different reasons.  when you exercise, you use a lot of your body's energy (sugar).  drinking water obviously isn't enough for you.  it may seem kinda counter intuitive, the opposite of what you would think, but you might have to snack after working out.  The snack should be a light food, otherwise you could end up feeling nauseous which isn't good either.  Try a yogurt or (maybe) fruit.  Your body is having a problem regulating sugar.

A 1 week old baby will make you feel like you do nothing but nurse.  That is how you bring in your supply.  At this point, you should be nursing AT LEAST every 2 hours.  Nursing more is good.

For example, my goal several years ago was to graduate from college.  I started out and I really found myself struggling and sinking rather than being able to stay afloat.  I failed a class in college after being an A student in high school.  I realized that setting a goal as abstract as """"graduate from college"""" was not going to help me.  I needed to focus on the here and now.  So I had a goal of graduating from college, but I set a more specific objective that for the current semester I would get straight A's no matter how much work it took.  I focused on this objective each semester and I actually managed to succeed in obtaining straight As in all of my classes and graduated college as the valedictorian commencement speaker for a graduating class of thousands of students.  Clearly I had not only met my goal ,but exceeded what I ever could have imagined doing.  Like you, I had mental health issues, and while I didn't get into any legal troubles, I never sought out the help I needed which would have eased my load a lot over the years.

My advice to you would be narrow your focus on the here and now.  It's great to have long-term aspirations, but what are you going to do right now to help you get there... you need to plan out where you want your life to be in one day, one month, one year, etc.  No one wakes up one morning and magically has all of their hopes and dreams come true.  Through hard work and many, many failures you begin to make progress toward your dreams.  It's not easy and when you combine a mental illness with attaining your dreams, it makes it that much more difficult.  Not impossible by any means.  You need to start by sitting down and thinking not about what your dreams are (because clearly you already know), but rather figure out what you need to do to get there.  Suddenly you will feel that your life has direction and purpose and YOU WILL SUCCEED.  

I also want to applaud you for getting the help you need for your psychological issue.  You have more strength to do that than many people, including myself.  That is a great first step in achieveing your desires and in working with your therapist, you will undoubtedly be able to further develop your plans of how you are going to reach your dreams.

3046890,Is this a sesamoid bone injury?,"About 7-8 months ago, I fell and injured a bone in my foot. There was a hard boney lump at the injury and it swelled for a few days but I ignored it up until now. The swelling went away, but the boney bump never did, neither did the pain. This past weekend, I fell and re-injured the same spot, again causing it to swell. The swelling has gone away again, but the pain is terrible!! I can barely walk. I went to the Dr and she initially thought it was a broken bone that healed incorrectly and then calcified. Now after looking at the x-rays, she thinks it is a Sesamoid bone irritation. After checking online, I just don't think this sounds correct. The lump is on the inner part of the arch of my foot, but towards the top of the foot, not the sole. I want a second opinion, but I am just curious what other people think until I can get one.","I have had Sesamoiditis in the third metatarsal of my left foot from a trauma resulting from an impact against a hurdle. This is a common track injury and it hurts like h*ll. One thing you can be sure of, is that with rest, it will eventually shrink, unless it's already developed calcification deposits. First, I think your Dr is right about her diagnosis. Second, prepare yourself for the possibility of minor surgery to remove the bump. It sounds like its badly irritating neighboring nerves, which could get more serious over time. I think my case was less serious than yours because it only lasted a couple of months!

RELAX!!!! If you already have two boys, there is every reason to think you can have a third.  And there is no need to have sex every day (not unless you just want to).   There are only a few days out of the month when you can get pregnant and that is while you are ovulating.  I had my son at forty and had no problem getting pregnant when I was ready by doing the following:
#1  Waited three months after getting off contraceptives so I would have a healthy egg and sperm and knew when to expect my periods.
#2  I bought ovulation tests (they sell cheap at Walmart and you just pee on the stick).  You can also tell when ovulation begins by the eggwhite discharge (I know thats gross but I want to help).
11 days after my period, I began using the test.  When I peed on a stick and indicated my peak ovulation, I had a lot of sex during the next three days.
#3  After sex, I propped a pillow under my butt and watched tv a little while

Now onto medications/treatments. First, if you are IR (Insulin Resistant) then you should be on Metformin & a diet plan (talk to your doctor on what will work best for you). The first medication they will probably have you take is Clomid.

Usually there are signs that MG is a diagnosis for symptoms that include confusion and declining motor function first, as the brain controls this, and anything else after that.
MG is completely diagnosable. The test is called the Tensilon Test, basically the drug Tensilon is given and if there is a positive response, ie, her throat opens back up and her heart beat returns to it's usual, she has MG and a more permanent treatment is started.

3859275,Is this insomnia?,"I've never been a very good sleeper. When I was a little kid my mom could never get me to go to sleep, I always wanted to stay up late watching tv or something. Nowadays of course I am free to stay up as late as I like. Sometimes I stay up as late (or early) as 6am, partly because I enjoy the peace and quiet once everyone else has gone to bed, but also because I never feel like I can get to sleep until I really am exhausted. I know this isn't normal, but do you think it's a problem? I've been to my doctor before about sleeping trouble, but that was when I had issues with stress and could never get to sleep at all.

NOW DIE ?","Hi,
I am so sorry that you are going through this.  Unfortunately, I think most people who have chronic medical problems have had similar experiences (I know I have) and of course, I do not think you should give up.  I totally understand wanting to give up because I have felt that way after being treated by incompetent physicians, rude and condescending staff, etc.  But remember, this is your life and you have to try to hang in there with this.  YOU know that your seizures are """"real,"""" it's just going to be a question of getting to the right person.  I know you feel like you've tried and tried, but it might just be the next doctor you talk to.  

I know you are upset and I don't exactly understand what you are saying, but most (good) psychiatrists know that many of the medications that they give can cause symptoms like seizures and tremors, etc.  It seems like they should be able to clearly see what you are saying (as I understand it):  you were misdiagnosed with a mental illness, given medication which caused temporal lobe epilepsy and that now temporal lobe epilepsy is your """"main"""" diagnosis; not the mental illness.  I hope I'm understanding you properly.

Your situation sounds so stressful, I don't even know where to start with how to help you.  For example, I think you could be helped SO much by a support group for people with epilepsy/seizures.  You are probably already familiar with the epilepsy foundation.  I put the link below.  They have a place on there where you can locate support in your area.  Then, maybe at the support group, you may find someone who thinks they have the greatest, most caring neurologist in the world and you could try to see that person.

I'm thinking that maybe when these physicians see your chart and see all of the mental health diagnoses, they are, like you said, """"writing you off"""" to a degree - it does still happen unfortunately.  You've probably already done this, but in the visit, I would bring my films (x-rays/ C.T.'s, etc.) and whatever documentation you have that you have temporal lobe epilepsy as your primary diagnosis.

In the broad scheme of things, it probably doesn't really matter if they are treating you for a mental illness or for the epilepsy as long as you get the treatment you need.  Like I said, a psychiatrist COULD be the right person for the job.  I don't know.

I guess I don't have any answers, but I wanted to reach out to you mainly to tell you to get some rest, maybe take a little break from doctors (I do that some times) and then maybe things will look a little more optimistic to you.

I couldn't tell from your question if you were just very frustrated and were saying, """"now die?"""" or if you really meant it.  Because I am a social worker, I need to make sure that if any time you feel like you might hurt yourself or someone else, you should either go to the emergency room and/or call the 24-hour crisis line where you live.  I put a link to the national suicide/crisis hotline below.  Calling either of these numbers DOES NOT MEAN that you are crazy or suicidal.  It means you need someone to talk to about your frustrations; someone who won't judge you and who will help you get through the night.

INTRODUCTION ï¿½ Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of infertility in women [1], and is primarily characterized by ovulatory dysfunction and hyperandrogenism. The diagnosis of PCOS has life-long implications with increased risk for infertility, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and possibly cardiovascular disease. It should be considered in any adolescent girl with hirsutism, persistent acne, menstrual irregularity, or obesity.

The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents are presented here. The definition, pathogenesis, and treatment of PCOS in adolescents are discussed separately. (See """"Definition, pathogenesis, and etiology of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents"""" and see """"Treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents"""").

CLINICAL FEATURES ï¿½ It is important to appreciate that PCOS is a syndrome, not a disease, reflecting multiple potential etiologies and variable clinical presentations. Adolescent girls with PCOS may present with hirsutism, menstrual irregularities, obesity, acanthosis nigricans, premature pubarche, and/or precocious puberty (show figure 1). Any one of these findings may be the sole feature of the syndrome. Treatment-resistant acne, scalp hair loss, seborrhea, or hyperhidrosis also may be presenting chief complaints.

Hirsutism ï¿½ Hirsutism is defined clinically as excessive sexual hair that appears in a male pattern [2]. Hirsutism is commonly graded according to the Ferriman-Gallwey system, which quantitates the extent of hair growth in the most androgen-sensitive areas (show figure 2). In adult women, a score of <8 is normal, 8 to 15 indicates mild hirsutism, and >15 indicates moderate to severe hirsutism.

Hirsutism must be distinguished from hypertrichosis, the generalized excess growth of hair that sometimes occurs on a hereditary basis, or in patients taking glucocorticoids, phenytoins, diazoxide, or cyclosporine. Hypertrichosis is distributed in a nonsexual pattern (eg, generalized distribution or more prominent distribution on the forehead or shoulders) and is not caused by excess androgen, although it may be aggravated by excess androgen.

Acne vulgaris, pattern alopecia, seborrhea, hyperhidrosis, and hidradenitis suppurativa are considered to be hirsutism equivalents [3]. Hyperandrogenism should be considered in adolescent females who have inflammatory acne that is unusual in its age of onset (before midpuberty), severity, persistence, or unresponsiveness to standard therapy.

Hirsutism and hirsutism equivalents are variably expressed manifestations of excess androgens that are present in approximately two-thirds of hyperandrogenic females [2,3]. The absence of hirsutism in approximately one-third of hyperandrogenic women appears to be because of relatively low sensitivity of their pilosebaceous unit to androgens. In addition, hirsutism may be absent in young adolescents whose hyperandrogenism has not evolved fully.

Not all hirsutism is caused by hyperandrogenism. Approximately one-half of mildly hirsute women and one-sixth of moderately hirsute women do not have androgen excess, but have idiopathic hirsutism. (See """"Evaluation of women with hirsutism"""").

Ovarian findings 

Polycystic ovaries ï¿½ Although PCOS in adolescents has clinical and endocrine features similar to those in adults, the detection of polycystic ovaries with ultrasonography appears to be less sensitive in adolescents (show radiograph 1) [3]. In a comparison of consecutively studied hyperandrogenic females, polycystic ovaries were found in 55 percent of adolescents and 75 percent of adults. This difference, however, may reflect the limitation of imaging virginal adolescents by the abdominal route compared with the higher-definition transvaginal route used in adults. A polycystic ovary may not develop until two or more years after menarche [4].

Okay, you've said that augmentin helped you. When I ran a quick search, I found it was related to penicillin. So that means that you're probably still dealing with some very stubborn infections.

Try drinking cranberry juice. At the very least, it shouldn't hurt (unless you're allergic). And it has been shown to be effective against a number of harmful bacteria. Try eating and drinking to boost your immune system. That might also help your energy problem- and as uncomfortable as you are, I would be surprised if you were resting. So the fatigue doesn't surprise me at all. Also, if you are drinking a lot of soda, stop. Drink teas instead. Those are quite tasty, and also have stuff that is good for you.

424111,"Whats the cause of this desease called """"Polyteritis Nodosa""""?","Last August I lost a 14 year boy who suffered from a disease called Polyteritis Nodosa. It took time for the doctors to discover it. They took XRAYS,SCAN until discovered he has an infection though at first they were treating Malaria. After his leg swell then they discovered that he has an infection which is not common here in Africa. And we wonder where could have the boy got the disease. Doctors said it is common in Japan and Canada. But this boy has never travelled to oversease countries. So they tried their best to treat him but my son died. Thank you.","Hi,

Sorry to hear about your son. 

The disease is called polyarteritis nodosa. It's a disease that causes inflammation in blood vessels which leads to their destruction. 

The disease involves many organs in the body. It can present as a self limited disease that has only skin lesions or as a severe disease that involves many organs which leads to their disfunction, and to death. 

Nothing is known at the moment about the genetics of the disease. In the USA it occurs in 9-17 out of 1,000,000 people. It usually affects people of all ages and is much more common in males than females. 

The causes of the disease are unclear as of today. There is evidence that maybe the immunologic system in the body is responsible, because when checking for values of factors in the blood that usually go up in diseases that have an immune cause, these factors go up in this disease as well. 

These include:
1. antibodies of the type endothelial COH
2. antibodies that are common in other diseases of blood vessels, called ANCA
3. There is also a connection with infection from Hepatitis virus (that causes a liver disease usually). In 30% of people with the disease the virus was found in the blood. It's possible that the body's response to the virus causes the disease.",Polyteritis Nodosa,,,NA,So they tried their best to treat him but my son died,son died,NA,NA,,,,,we wonder where could have the boy got the disease,polyarteritis nodosa,,,NA,NA,,,,,,,,Yes: Whats the cause of this desease,Yes: Last August I lost a 14 year boy,,,,Yes: Sorry to hear about your son.

ANd here are some ideas....not sure what you have tried.
Most people swallow this material without ever noticing it, while it is still tiny. In those whose tonsils are large, however, the particles can lodge in the deep crypts, where they continue to grow. The enlarging lumps are called calculi of the tonsil, or tonsilloliths (tonsil stones). These stones are most common during adolescence.

Microscopic studies of these tonsilloliths have shown them to contain a combination of food particles, bacteria, oral debris, and white blood cells in a concentrically laminated pattern -- rather like a pearl. Usually they are small gritty particles found in the center of soft, cheesy flecks. Sometimes, however, they become quite large, appearing as rough, yellow or gray, round stones. At times they reach an extraordinary size. Affected people usually have a history of repeated attacks of tonsillitis in earlier years.

Most people with calculi of the tonsils have no associated symptoms. In that case nothing need be done, except perhaps for brushing or scraping them out, as your daughter does. Gargling, refraining from eating during the 30 minutes before falling asleep, and careful oral hygiene may help minimize their formation.

For some people, however, the calculi can be quite bothersome, causing a constant foreign-body sensation, a chronic low-grade sore throat, recurrent episodes of tonsillitis persisting beyond childhood, or chronic bad breath.

Treatment consists of either removing the tonsils or removing the calculi. Troublesome large calculi that are not easily dislodged may need an ear, nose, and throat doctor to remove them.  http://www.drgreene.com/21_568.html
Tonsil Stones don't do any physical harm, and sporadically coughing them up doesn't mean that there is anything wrong. However, they can be annoying and sometimes they are an indication that you have bad breath. Normally, Normally one does not do much for them, except gargle with hydrogen peroxide. A simple combination of drugs and nasal drops can effectively eliminate tonsil stones without unnecessary tonsil surgery. Plus, occasional use of a nasal spray helps neutralise the anaerobic sulfur-producing bacteria on contact.   http://www.doctorndtv.com/topicsh/Tonsil%20stones.asp
The only sure-fire method for ridding yourself of this problem is to have your tonsils removed (tonsillectomy), but there are nonsurgical alternatives which you should certainly pursue before you ask an ENT to take out your tonsils:
 You could try gargling frequently with warm salt water (1 teaspoon of table salt mixed with one pint of water gargle with about 1/4 cup of this mixture three times per day, after meals.)
 You could also gargle with a mouthwash called Alkalol, which is essentially salt water combined with a variety of natural aromatic extracts; some people prefer Alkalol to plain salt water. Most other commercial mouthwashes contain sugar or alcohol, which are pleasant-tasting but are, in the long run, fairly irritating if used frequently.
 There is a doctor in Los Angeles, Murray Grossan, who markets a water-jet device for """"hosing down"""" the tonsils. Relative to gargling, this device provides a more aggressive technique for clearing out those nasty crypts.
 In the hopes of avoiding tonsillectomy, I will often put my patient on a long (3 to 4 week) course of antibiotics in the hope that this will allow the tonsils to """"settle down"""" (become less inflamed.) I must admit that antibiotics are not a very effective cure for this problem.  http://www.doctorhoffman.com/xlith.htm

'need an answer' you state you are a medical professional. All I can say is thank god I dont have anything to do with you. What a closed mind. As someone also in the medical profession, what you allude to certainly does happen however you are being extremely judgemental here, and remember it's the internet here. sounds like you are purely siding with the doctor.... people usually do that to protect their own.

I prefer to have an open mind and treat each patient as an individual, have in my mind the potential reasons why patients have complications... but assess each case on it's own merits.

'treefrog' - nice answer. Hope you are going well.

To help the person asking this question however ----

Sepsis and septic infection literally means an infection around the site.. which has the potential to travel around the body and cause many more serious problems. It is not uncommon to have infections after a surgery. The professionals involved do everything they can to reduce the risk however  they cannot reduce the risk to zero. We all have bugs that live on our skin happily, healthily fighting off other viruses and bugs that we come into contact with. It's when these bugs get into your system, into a spot they shouldnt that they cause trouble. The treatment you have undegone is fairly standard for your condition and complication ( in regards to the antibiotics) It is vitally important that the infection get under control so that your knee surgery can finally be finished.

However if you had told me this story... I would have the following concerns - 

1. Sounds like the doctor, by what you describe here, isnt listening to you, or is... but not allaying your fears. that is all about communication. If potentially he isnt hearing what you are saying, or not explaining things properly because you may be too upset to listen properly, my suggestion is to take a friend along to your next appointment. Have a list of questions written down and ask them, one by one. Do not give your doctor the list, just ask them the way you have written them - its your list, you need to understand it.

2. The doctor removing medication from your handbag. I am afraid no professional has the right to do this. The medication is legally prescribed, you have had it legally dispensed from a pharmacist, it has your name on it. It is yours. My question here to him would be... why did you do that... why havent you sent them to me... If he thinks you may be starting to have an addiction to pain medication... then he has handled it poorly. Communication is the key again. He has taken your pain medication and not sent it.... maybe I can jump to conclusions like 'need an answer' did and say the doctor is taking the medication himself and he is addicted????

Assumptions dont help. Getting you comfortable and pain free and on the right treatment is the goal here.

Take a friend along, ask the questions, if you dont get satisfactory answers, then seek a second opinion. Maybe it isnt your fault, but a fault of the doctor in question.

After all.... we are all human. sometimes everyone needs to be reminded of that.

They put her on prednisone (steroid) a yr ago at a high dose and the symptoms got better right away. We were told that she has FUO (Fever of unknown origin)which might be caused by a hyperactive immune system.

Those behaviors that make her strange are probably the symptoms of Asperger's.  She probably says things without thinking about the consequences of what she is saying.  She probably has some trouble with humor, tells jokes that really aren't funny or doesn't laugh at funny jokes until other people around her laugh.  She may display emotions that don't fit with the situation.  By the way, kids who have undiagnosed Asperger's are generally called weird by thier peers.

608096,Compulsive Eating Disorder?,"I know that I have this disorder. All that I do, especially when nobody is around, is eat. I cannot stop it when I eat.

I have also had anorexia nervosa, so it is not surprising that I have another eating disorder. What is causing all of this? How can I get my life back in the balance?

Thank you for the responses. It may mean more than you'll ever know.","you may have the disorder called binge eating. when you eat that many calories in such a short amount of time you probably feel like you have no control over it. this feeling leads you to eat more and feel guilty afterwards. this can lead to bulimia if not fixed fast! what makes you feel like you have to eat is the anticiaption of the food and it makes you not care about what you will feel like after eating too much.  most of the food you eat is probably junk food and this is because you may have felt deprived earlier. it is a vicious cycle. if you find yourself eating alone in private this is a sign that you may be embarassed about it and that you may be eating for emotional problems. i am actually goin thru something similar but i told myself im goin to end it tonight. think to yourself that you are not a prisoner of food. You are in charge of your actions and what you eat. The food will always be there you can choose to eat it or not. Also wen you feel like binging stop yourself before hand. and think am i really hungry or not? if not what do i really want? and wen you are reaching for the food stop for a second and ask if that food will make you feel satisfied and happy afterward...most likely it will make you feel depressed and guilty. understand that food cannot fill an emotional void. eating more of it will only make things worse. when you feel like stuffing your mouth sit down take a few snacks out lay them on the table. ask yourself all these questions. and if you still want to eat, eat very very SLOWLY. soon you might realize that the food will not satisfy you. Then after the first few bites you wont crave it. Eat  balanced heatlhy  meals so you wont feel deprived. The main reasons for binging is low self esteem. you put too much value on weight and appearance. Know that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and your beauty is only true when you accept it. Learn to appreciate your body and all the wonderful things it does. No matter what your weight is or how skinny you are if you dont believe in your own beauty you will never be content. you can end the cycle now its all in the mind. best of luck!",Compulsive Eating Disorder,,,NA,How can I get my life back in the balance?,anorexia nervosa,,,"All that I do, especially when nobody is around, is eat.

In general, the term """"hammer toe"""" describes a buckling of any of the toe joints. Joints at the end or middle of the toe, as well as the joint near the ball of the foot, may be affected. Toe joints usually curl because of a muscle imbalance or tight tendons. Hammer toes vary in severity and in the number of joints and toes involved.

Types of Hammer Toes
Hammer toes may be flexible or rigid, depending on the joint's ability to move. A flexible joint may become more rigid as you age.The doctor will examine all your toes, testing whether or not buckled joints can be moved. Your feet will also be checked for any skin changes. Corns (a buildup of dead skin cells) often form between curled toes or on top of buckled joints where shoes rub. If irritated, corns may turn into open wounds and become infected.If your symptoms are mild, changing shoes may be all the treatment you need. If your symptoms are severe, surgery may be needed. The type of procedure often depends on whether your toe joints are flexible or rigid.

Unfortunately, from what I read, it sounds like the only treatment is surgery (since you said it wasn't her shoes).

On the adderall, my symptoms practically dissappeared except would have elevated irritability 4 hours after my dose. the PA i see will not prescribed Extended release for some strange reason and isn't considering Ritalin because i told him that once, in college, i took it for fun and it made me wired. the other suggestions aren't even indicated for ADD (narcolepsy) and i already have insomnia as it is. what med seems to work best for adult women with moderate ADD?","I have the same problem as you!! In undergrad I was just fine, cause i can b/s but now in med school its harder. I just take ADDERRAL before i have to study.

Adderal works best for me that way.  I dont take ADDERAL for any other time except when its time for me to study.  I think its best that way. I do agree though, it makes me irritable too; however i accomplish my goal of sitting on my butt and studying and being able to concentrate. I tried Ritalin, it does'nt do anything for me really.  So, just take it when you're studying; It works for me that way. In either case, no matter what you do, amphetamines are pretty nasty puppies. So..... its going to have side effects.

Also a good tacket is if telling her all that stuff doesn't work, have her lay down on the couch close her eyes and have her a """"funeral"""" (I know it sounds bad,but it really does help) she is not aloud to talk. But you all come up to her say everything you love. And talk about how the disorder killed her and how it has affected you. Tell her what ended up happening to all of you after she died.

3897103,Do diseases vary among race?,I've heard that Lupus is primarily a disease among asians and native Americans. My grandmother is half Cherokee Indian. My mother died 3 years ago from the complications of lupus and the drugs she was taking. I've also heard that African Americans are more likely to get menningitis than others. Sickle cell anemia seems to be another disease among blacks. Is this accurate? And if it is: what genetic factors are involved with this?,"The frequency of diseases do vary by race to some degree. The most common reason is genetic or cultural or unknown.  For instance diabetes is very common in the Indian populations in Upstate New York because of the many years of inbreeding in the small population. Glucose levels can be on the average twice as high than the normal white population.  There are cultural traditions in some sub-populations that cause diseases - one which was common on Islands in the pacific was some thing called Laughing Disease - It was caused by eating the brain of the tribal member you just killed.  The brain carried a virus that infected the brain of the guy who is eating the brain.  Ugh

A recently medical study out of John Hopkins which compared more than 15,000 patients comparing disease out comes found that there were still poorer results for certain races when compared to the average population and they could not uncover the cause because all  of the studied population receive identical treatment. They assumed that there was some cause for the statical variation but they made no clinical conclusion other than it was unknown at this time.  

Lupus is found in all populations to some degree and I have never heard that it is more common in Asians and native Americans. As far as meningitis in Africans - I have not found any study that confirms it is more common.  You are correct that sickle cell anemia is much more common in blacks than other populations and that is a genetic issue. 

If you are Eastern European or Italian and have the gene called HLA- B27 - you will have the potential for more intestinal diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, and other diseases related to that gene. Having gene does not mean you will get the diseases it means you will have a great probability to come down with these diseases.",Do diseases vary among race,,,NA,My mother died 3 years ago from the complications of lupus and the drugs she was taking.,mother died,,,,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,,,,Do diseases vary among race?,,,,,Not applicable

When someone is having a heart attack, we tell them to cough forcefully or to bear down as if to have a large bowel movement.  This coughing process slows the heart rate, which would explain your sudden dizziness.  As for the headaches and the chest pain, that is quite understandable, since you are exerting high amounts of pressure on those muscles.

3353726,Questions about herpes?,"In August I was diagnosed with Herpes, and my outbreak was pretty bad.  I had sores in my cervix, urethra, and some in my vaginal opening.  About 1 week ago, I had my second outbreak.  This time much much less severe.  It was only a small bump on the vaginal lip and was gone within 4-5 days.  I know it was a herpes outbreak because I went to the doctor.  Now, I have several small clustered bumps on my inner thigh, that release clear liquid and itch.  I don't know where that came from.  I have not had sexual intercourse between the two outbreaks.  My questions are this:

1. I know that herpes is contagious, but is it contagious within your own body?  Meaning, if I touched the sore that was on the vaginal lip, and then touched my inner thigh, is my thigh now infected with the virus?

2.  Can an outbreak be so close together?  It was only a week ago that I had my second outbreak.  

Please help, serious answers only please.  

Thanks a lot!","The Herpes virus causes both the outbreak that you can get on your genitals, and also is the cause of coldsores that you get around your mouth (although I've heard that if you have one, you cannot get the other). It is incurable (unfortunatly) but for most people, outbreaks are rare, and in some cases after the initial outbreak, they never have another (although they still carry the virus). It an be transmitted from area to area both on your own body and from person to person. Again in some cases, outbreaks will clear up on their own without any medication, however if an outbreak is severe, or doens't go away you should see your doctor. Your thigh is infected with the virus and outbreaks can be close together. In the same way as coldsores, outbreaks tend to happen when you are stressed or feeling under the weather as your immune system isn't at top levels. To help prevent further outbreaks keep your vitamin intake high, especially vit. C by eating lots of fresh, uncooked fruit and veg and drinking lots of OJ. You will always carry the virus (unless they find a cure) so always use a condom when having sex to prevent further infection to other people and always wash your hands after touching an infected area to prevent further infection on yourself. Also, if the doctor didn't already do it, get checked out for other STDs. Ones like Chlamydia often have no symptoms but can casue infertility and if yuo have Herpes, you may have other STDs.",herpes,,Female,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I don't know where that came from.,I have not had sexual intercourse,,,,is it contagious within your own body?

This should have been done initially if you suspected an STD which it does sound like. 
Many doctors in this day and age are beginning to decrease the amount of STD tests done, stupid it know, as they believe the STD epidemic is declining as people become more familiar with safe sex.

Back to your question, has this always happend when you have had sex? No? Then something has obviously developed. Either demand further testing from your doctor or give him/her a sample on the spot. Yes I mean go out and obtain a sample of the gunk on a swab. If you tell the doctor before hand they should be able to give you a pathology swab with a special tube to keep it in. 

Another variation on your symptoms is a blockage of the ducts out of the scrotum, this would cause a blockage and swelling of the vessels giving the illusion your right ball is swallon. Once the body acts to right this wrong the semen would ooze out as it is the only place it can go.

Either way you need to see a specialist if your doctor is being complacent about the issue!

2466138,"For Bi-Polar II disorder, what seems to help with the severe depressions along with medications?","Hello,
My mother was diagnosed with Bi-polar back in 1993 and has had to be court ordered to take medications following three very sever manic episodes.  This past year was the last, and she was in the hospital for several months.  She has her medications stable again, Lithium, and a couple new ones. This time around she and my dad ended up divorcing as a result, and I have helped her restart a new life on her own.  She is very depressed and I know that doctors don't necessarily recommend anti-depresents with bi-polar disorder.  Is there something to help her from being so depressed?  She has a fear of doctors as well, which doesn't help.  I try to see her as often as I can, but it is very hard to see her so despondent.  She won't take care of herself or her new place.  We have found a program to help with a nurse three times a day and house cleaning.  But it seems as soon as I go away she will resort back to watching tv/sleeping and crying all the time. Any help???",It has been proven that combined treatment of medication and therapy go hand in hand.

222746,What happens after preeclamsia?,"When I was pregnant with my son (my first and only pregenancy) I was diagnosed with preeclampsia. Because of that my obstetrician induced labor two weeks before my due date and took the baby via a c-section as he was concerned that my blood pressure was going up despite my medication dosage being increased. After I had my son and went to visit my doctor for my 6 weeks check up, I was told that my blood pressure had returned to normal. However a few months ago (January/ Febuary) I had to go to the doctor, and during that time when a routine blood pressure check was done, the doctor found that my blood pressure was high. I was prescribed medication for a few days to settle it; the doctor thought the blood pressure could have risen because of lack f rest. However recently I have found that my heart at times gives this fluttering feeling and my pulse races at times. I'm going to have a medical check-up, but is this a sign that I'm hypertensive at just 26 years old?!","Wow, you kinda tucked two questions in there.  One at a time...

(1)  What happens after preeclamsia? 
A:  PREeclampsia is a set of three conditions:  hypertension, protein in the urine, and edema (swelling).  Eclampsia is what happens after preeclampsia, and that's a seizure.  Preeclampsia is VERY serious, the usual treatment is to end your pregnacy (usually but not always, with an induced delivery).  However, preeclampsia can happen up to (but not more than) six weeks following delivery.  What ever is going on with you is NOT preeclampsia.  

(2)  but is this a sign that I'm hypertensive at just 26 years old?! 
A:  Fluttering and racing pulses are not related to hypertension.  They may be serious, they may not.  The hypertension that you went through was most likely due to a shallow implantation of your fetus.  If the fetus doesn't implant deep enough into your uterus, then the arteries feeding the placenta cannot grow big enough, and your body compensates by increasing its blood pressure in an effor to nourish the child.  Preeclampsia is definately not a concern.  But that doesn't mean there can't be other things wrong too.",preeclampsia,25-34 years old,Female,,,,,,recently I have found that my heart at times gives this fluttering feeling and my pulse races at times.,my blood pressure was high / preeclampsia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,is this a sign that I'm hypertensive at just 26 years old?!,,,,,Not applicable

Signs to look for:
1. Low preasure front in your area. Is it about to rain or an overcast day?
2. Triggered by food allergies? Such as Cheese, food colouring, red wine, alcohol, Red wine vinegar, ginger chocolate., and many more can be added to this list. 
Also watch for the combination of 1 and 2 togather. As one trigger alone amy not be enough to cause a headach.
Also signs of a migrain headach: sensitivity to light and sound. Blurred vission. pain in one eye. headaches tend to be felt on one side of the head, but speaking from much experience pain can be felt in other areas as well. Nausuea and or vomiting. Can result in dry coughing (which is vomiting until you have nothing left in you but your body keeps vomiting anyway, painfull)

 Treatment : cartain Migraine medication prescribed by your doctor.  or ADVIL / ADVIL LIQUID / MIGRAINE ADVIL. 
Never take Tylenol for a Migrain head ache as Tylenol will cause 'rebound' headaches a day or two latter which can be just as bad or worse than the original head ache. Don't wait until the pain is too terrible before taking an ADVIL as delaying can result in vomiting and dry coughing which could have been otherwise avoided. Avoid your triggers especially if you have a headache in progress.

Any help please",Sed Rate range differ depending on gender and age.  The best thing for you to do is talk to your doctor about your concerns. Wounds with mrsa that have closed are difficult to detect if the mrsa is gone.  I work in a facility and deal with mrsa from time to time. There are different types of mrsa. from the lungs to the urine. I asked one of our doctors about mrsa in the wound and how someone can tell if the mrsa is gone and she told me that there is no 100% way of knowing. Usually when the wound closes and the patient has been treated properly with antibiotic (usually vancomycin) it is considered to be treated. If the wound heals with no signs and symptoms of infection (no swelling or redness) then there is no infection.  She also told me that everyone has a small amount of mrsa in the body. It is the level of mrsa that the person needs treated.  If his red blood cell count is low and iron is down it might be good to have him on an iron deficiency otc med. He might be anemic.  The best advice I can give you is ask your family physician and also your surgical doctor of your concerns. This is also why they get paid.

She must be as worried as you are, but the less stress she has to deal with the better. Give her as much support and understanding as you can.
This does sound like epiepsy and not a mental illness, I don't know why people have said that. It can make her 'spaced out' and unaware of her surroundings, and hear sounds and voices, and smell odd smells; especially just before she has a fit.
I can't imagine what all this feels like from her point of view but she must be aware that her friends don't go through this. Its tough and very unfair on you both. At least you are aware there's a problem and are getting her help.
When you go to the hospital take a pen and paper and write things down, when they are telling you a lot of stuff it gets difficult to remember. Ask them to spell things if you don't know how. If the consultant can't speak to you in plain english just keep asking """"what does that mean in laymans tems"""" until you get a straight answer. Ask for leaflets and support groups.
And also don't forget that you will need support too.

Tender, swollen breasts
One of the early signs of pregnancy is sensitive, sore breasts caused by increasing levels of hormones. The soreness may feel like an exaggerated version of how your breasts feel before your period. Your discomfort should diminish significantly after the first trimester, as your body adjusts to the hormonal changes. 

Fatigue
Feeling tired all of a sudden? No, make that exhausted. No one knows for sure what causes early pregnancy fatigue, but it's possible that rapidly increasing levels of the hormone progesterone are contributing to your sleepiness.

You should start to feel more energetic once you hit your second trimester, although fatigue usually returns late in pregnancy when you're carrying around a lot more weight and some of the common discomforts of pregnancy make it more difficult to get a good night's sleep

Nausea or vomiting
If you're like most women, morning sickness won't hit until about a month after conception. (A lucky few escape it altogether.) But some women do start to feel queasy a bit earlier. And not just in the morning, either ï¿½ pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting can be a problem morning, noon, or night.

About half of women with nausea feel complete relief by the beginning of the second trimester. For most others it takes another month or so for the queasiness to ease up. 

Increased sensitivity to odors
If you're newly pregnant, it's not uncommon to feel repelled by the smell of a bologna sandwich or cup of coffee and for certain aromas to trigger your gag reflex. Though no one knows for sure, this may be a side effect of rapidly increasing amounts of estrogen in your system. You may also find that certain foods you used to enjoy are suddenly completely repulsive to you. 

Abdominal bloating
Hormonal changes in early pregnancy may leave you feeling bloated, similar to the feeling some women have just before their period arrives. That's why your clothes may feel snugger than usual at the waistline, even early on when your uterus is still quite small. 

Frequent urination
Shortly after you become pregnant, you may find yourself hurrying to the bathroom all the time. Why? Mostly because during pregnancy the amount of blood and other fluids in your body increases, which leads to extra fluid being processed by your kidneys and ending up in your bladder.

This symptom may start as early as six weeks into your first trimester and continue or worsen as your pregnancy progresses and your growing baby exerts more pressure on your bladder. 

A missed period
If you're usually pretty regular and your period doesn't arrive on time, you'll probably take a pregnancy test long before you notice any of the above symptoms. But if you're not regular or you're not keeping track of your cycle, nausea and breast tenderness and extra trips to the bathroom may signal pregnancy before you realize you didn't get your period. 

Your basal body temperature stays high
If you've been charting your basal body temperature and you see that your temperature has stayed elevated for 18 days in a row, you're probably pregnant

Please help....

Benign positional vertigo is a diagnosis of the symptom but not what is causing it..besides you have more problems than the vertigo. Would make a pretty complicated diagnosis if all the symptoms were included in that diagnosis, as is the vertigo.

Also, I figured if I had to have some stuff done that I could do both at once and that way I could get it over with all at the same time. Any help would be appreciated!","This should have been arranged before your appointment. It is up to your doctor to order and schedule both tests. To show up and expect that the MRI technologist will just do both is very inconsiderate of the patients that will follow your appointment as a MRI usually takes  about 45 minutes and this will cause all the patients after you to be at least an hour late with their appointments.  If there is an open spot after your knee scheduled time, the tech can call your doctor and ask if it can be done, but this should have been brought up by you at your appointment with the ordering doctor. Many times, a reputable doctor will not order a test as expensive as an MRI without examining the patient.

OR, you can call the doctor before your appointment and have BOTH tests scheduled at once. You may have to switch days to do this, but it seems to be the best option.

You are awfully young for osteoporosis - are you on medications to help with that?  Have you considered surgical intervention for the knees?

Long term use of narcotics can cause you to not only become tolerant, but to develop extreme sensitivity to pain - things that don't normally cause pain might feel painful to you (opiate-induced hypersensitivity)

You are going to really regret it, if you ignore it, and it ends up being a cancer that could have been treated earlier.  Remember, you are talking about your BALLS.  You only get two of them, so you have to be diligent.  Talking to your parents can be awkward, but I am sure they would rather err on the side of caution.  If you absolutely cannot talk to your parents, call Planned Parenthood.  They do offer reproductive medical exams for men  and they provide it on a low/no fee scale.

Gradually, the depression eased somewhat but stayed at a low level trough March 2006. The anger raged throughout this depression. I finally had to make a decision. Get some help or find another job.

I'm 31yo, I've been doing cardio exercise for months now.  I noticed circulation probs that have become less severe since I quit smoking, but my arms still go to sleep easily while in bed. I also feel short of breath sometimes, when laying down & on the treadmill. The worst symptom is an intense """"pain"""" or empty feeling (somewhat hard to describe) emanating from my throat in the early mornings after I urinate, it keeps me from going back to sleep. I think """"angina"""" describes this pain, but it's in the throat--not the chest. I used to think this was a withdrawl symptom from nicotine. I used to get it back when I was a smoker; it would go away with my 1st morning cigarette. But as I weened myself off nicotine, first with nicorette gum, then cold turkey since Dec '05, the pains have gotten worse and sometimes persist into early afternoon, not every day but at least several days/week.  I also rarely get satisfying sleep.","It does sound a lot like acid reflux.  You may be supplementing your nicotine urges with food (especially before bed) or just the stress of resisting your urges may be causing some increased acid production.  

Angina is not typically after sleeping or urinating, unless it is """"unstable angina"""" which is unpredictable (but not consistently at the same time).  Throat pain can be angina, but usually is accompanied by sweating and shortness of breath and will sometimes radiate down to the chest with a crushing feeling.

As far as the acid reflux part of the equation (not likely Barrett's Esophagus, which is a change in the skin lining the esophagus), you should try taking an acid reducing medication once per day an hour before dinner.  You should also not eat any food at least 2-3 hours before bed, and if possible, you might want to put a phone book under each foot at the head of the bead.  

A couple of medications you can try (over the counter) are Prilosec, Pepcid or Zantac.  Avoid medications like Tums, Pepto, etc, which are short-acting and do not treat the underlying problem.  If your symptoms don't resolve after a week, you will need to have this problem looked at.

You are at significant cardiac risk (because of your other symptoms and history), so you should be getting regular check-ups (twice yearly minimum).  If you experience chest pain on the treadmill, you need to be seen IMMEDIATELY.

The following is a basic list of gall bladder disease symptoms: 

Gall Bladder Symptom 1 - Jaundice
As you may already know, the gall bladder is a holding vessel for bile flowing from the liver to the intestines. The symptoms of disease may vary, but the first and most obvious symptom is jaundice. If the skin becomes jaundiced, then we know that there is most likely an issue with the Gall Bladder or liver. Jaundice can either turn the skin yellow or orange depending on the type. With this, the whites of the eyes often take on a yellow color as well. Jaundice is the result of the liver not properly breaking down old blood and transforming it into bile. This can be the result of either the liver not functioning properly, or jaundice can indicate a blockage of the gall bladder.

Gall Bladder Symptom 2 - Gall Bladder Pain Symptoms
Gall Bladder Pain Symptom List - Types of Pain
Sporadic pains in the middle of the upper abdomen, or just below the ribs on the right side. 
The pain may spread to the right shoulder or between the shoulder blades.

The pain can be accompanied by nausea and vomiting and sometimes excessive wind. 
The attack can last from a few minutes to two to three hours before getting better. 
The frequency and severity of attacks is very variable. 
Attacks can be triggered by eating fatty foods such as chocolate, cheese or pastry. 
It can be difficult to distinguish the pain from other diseases, such as: gastric ulcer, back problems, heart pains, pneumonia and kidney stones. 
Gall Bladder Symptom 3 - Gall Stones
Symptoms of Gall Stones may include:

No Symptoms... Many people don't know they have gallstones. These ""silent stones"" are often found by accident from x-rays for other medical reasons. These stones may or may not require treatment. 
Abdominal pain 
Nausea 
Vomiting 
Indigestion 
Abdominal bloating 
Fatty food intolerance 
Biliary Colic 
Belching 
Gas 
Indigestion 
Certain symptoms indicate that there is a higher risk of danger and require immediate medical attention. These include:

Fever 
Sweating 
Chills 
Jaundice 
Yellow eyes 
Yellow skin 
Persistent pain 
Clay-colored stools (""Light Colored Stools"" or ""Pale Stools"") 
Gall Bladder Symptom 4 - Gall Bladder Atack Symptoms
An acute gall bladder attack symptom can occur at any time, such as the night or after a fatty meal. A gallstone attack indicates that medical attention is required. A gallstone attack usually is marked by a steady, severe pain in the upper abdomen. Attacks may last only 20 or 30 minutes but more often they last for one to several hours. A gallstone attack may also cause pain in the back between the shoulder blades or in the right shoulder and may cause nausea or vomiting. Attacks may be separated by weeks, months, or even years. Once a true attack occurs, subsequent attacks are much more likely.

Gall Bladder Attack Symptom List in Summary:

Upper abdominal pain 
Back pain - between the shoulder blades 
Pain under the right shoulder 
Nausea 
Vomiting 
Steady, severe pain in the upper abdomen that increases rapidly and lasts from 30 minutes to several hours. 
Pain in the back between the shoulder blades.

Here is some useful info.

Have you already gone through the full kidney and colon cleansing processes?

        Kidney cleanse is any procedure that involves drinking a huge amount of liquid, and taking care what you are eating. Just a better diet with more water can be enough! But, also any form of bowel cleansing will also help kidneys! The Master Cleanse Lemonade Diet  is also a Kidney cleanse, juice fasting is also a kidney cleanse, and any other form of fasting that incorporates a lot of liquids, will in the same time clean a kidney. Do you need special herbs? Only if you have acute lower back pain, clear symptom of Kidney stones (sharp glass like crystals, made of phosphoric acid, or sometimes may include other acids). In special occasions, you can get a kidney stone crystallized in less then a few days !!! To melt a stone/stones, you may need a few weeks, or one day with the Watermelon Cleanse.

         Herbal Kidney Cleanse  Designed by Dr. Hulda Clark from her book ""The Cure for All Disease"", explains in detail how to cleanse the kidneys, and her cleansing program will get rid of most if not all the stones, WITHOUT surgery.
        Ingredients:

            1/2 cup dried Hydrangea root
            1/2 cup Gravel root
            1/2 cup Marshmallow root
            4 bunches of fresh parsley
            Goldenrod tincture (leave this out of the recipe if you are allergic to it)
            Ginger Capsules
            Uva Ursi capsules
            Vegetable glycerine
            Vitamin B6 250mg
            Magnesium oxide 300mg or 1/4 cup Green Drink Beverage

        Measure _ cup of each root and set them to soak, Together in 10 cups of cold tap water, using a non-metal container and a non-metal lid (a dinner plate will do).  After four hours (or over night),    bring liquid with soaked herbs to a boil and simmer for 20 minutes.  Drink a _ cup as soon as it is cool enough.  Pour the rest in through a bamboo or plastic strainer into a sterile pint jar (glass) and several freezable containers.  Refrigerate the glass jar.
        Find fresh parsley at a grocery store that does not spray its produce (ask the owner). Boil the fresh parsley, after rinsing, in 1 quart of water for 3 minutes.  Strain out the liquid, then drink _ cup when cool enough.  Refrigerate a pint and freeze 1 pint.  Put the cooked parsley in your compost bucket.
        Dose:  each morning, pour together _ cup of the root mixture and _ cup parsley water, filling a large mug.  Add 20 drops of goldenrod tincture and 1 tbs. of glycerin.

        Drink this mixture in divided doses throughout the day. Keep cold. Do not drink it all at once or you will get a stomach ache and feel pressure in the bladder. If your stomach is very sensitive, start on half this dose.

        Save the roots after the first boiling, storing them in the freezer. After 13 days when your supply runs low, boil the same roots a second time, but add only 6 cups water and simmer only 10 minutes. This will last another 8 days, for a total of three weeks. You may cook the roots a third time if you wish, but the recipe gets less potent. If your problem is severe, only cook them twice.
        After three weeks, repeat with fresh herbs. You need to do the kidney cleanse for six weeks to get good results, longer for severe problems.

        Also take:

            Ginger capsules: one with each meal (3/day).
            Uva Ursi capsules: one with breakfast and two with supper
            Vitamin B6 (250mg): one per day
            Magnesium oxide (300mg): one a day

        Take these supplements just before your meal to avoid burping.

        Some notes on this recipe: this herbal tea, as well as the parsley, can easily spoil. Heat it to boiling every fourth day if it is being stored in the refrigerator; this resterilizes it. If you sterilize it in the morning you may take it","small intestine blocked, also kidney breakdown",75 years or older,Female,,how could all this happen at one time,"j tube, g tube and dialysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No

I think the DR. made a more specific diagnosis and I'm not being told.He was seen by a infectious disease specialist also. Doest STD's have to be reported to the health dept.?Would the DR. leave a diagnosis with 3 possibly causes? He was treated in hospital for 3 days. Would it be against the law for the doctor to tell me the diagnose,?I was there while the doctor was examining and questioning about safe sex.","Epididymitis is often a complication from bacterial infection of the urinary tract, so UTI is a pretty generic diagnosis. The doctor probably ran some tests to determine the actual pathogen (gonorrhea, chlamydia, assorted NGU, etc.). The results of these tests will be disclosed to your partner (the actual patient). Can a doctor give a diagnosis with three possible sources? ABSOLUTELY. Why? because only your partner knows what really happened, and people sure like to LIE when it comes to STDs.

As for STDs, a few of them are reportable depending on your location (which you neglected to state). When any disease gets reported to the health department, we keep that information confidential. Only if the person is deemed a significant risk to the public's health (such as in the case of TB or some STDs) will we send investigators to intervene. for example, this can include house calls by nurses and investigators. But usually, STD risks are considered to be caveat emptor -- meaning ""buyer beware, you should be smart enough to get your own dang condoms."" If you are afraid that your partner's protected health information will be leaked all over because his disease may be reportable, stop fretting. We would be fired, sacked and have the pants sued off us if we were to abuse that information.

And if you want to know about your partner's diagnosis, ask your partner. He is the one who would get that info.

About 2 months ago I went to my primary care doctor with intense fatigue & trigger point pain along my spine and flanks. He ruled out a rhuematological cause based on blood work and gave me prescription strength NSAIDs which left me sleepy but didn't really improve my condition. I have trace white blood cells and ""inflammation"" in my urine. My flanks hurt, my lower back hurts and my entire upper back and the area along the left side of my spine hurts. I don't ""hold"" the chiropractic adjustments and I'm thinking my problem is more serious and not related to my spine at all. If I had some type of cancer and it spread to my spine and bones, wouldn't it show up on spinal xrays? It really sucks to be in daily pain for 8 months with no respite.  I'm also terribly anemic, but the doc thinks this is due to the fact that I carry the trait for Thalassemia. I used to be a runner.","Have you discussed Fibromyalgia with your doctor?  There is no specific test for fibro, but a diagnosses is made when all other causes are ruled out.  A chiropracter would not help the symptoms of fibromyalgia, it affects the soft tissue not bones.  I ask because you conplaine of pain in the trigger points, fatigue which are common in fibro.  The pain is usually a deep muscle ache and spasms that can involve any part of the body.  Joint pain is common also.  Sleep disturbances are usually associated with fibro as well as restless leg syndrom, stiffness especially in the morning, anxiety and depression, pain worsening when there are changes in the barometric pressure before and after a storm, cold and humid weather also make the pain worst.  The trigger points become hard and hurt to touch.  If your doctor is not familiar with fibromyalgia I would suggest seeing someone who is qualified.  Its a complicated syndrome and there are many aspects that need to be treated in order to be able to function.  I was diagnossed 10 yrs ago and my doctor didn't know enough to treat me properly.  I am now disabled and have to take narcotics to aleviate the pain to a point where I am able to function with some normalcy.  I would think that a spinal xray would show a tumor, but I would ask for an MRI to rule out the posibility of a buldging or herniated disk or anyother problem with the spine.

What are the possible side effects of zolpidem? 
 ï¿½  If you experience any of the following serious side effects, stop taking zolpidem and seek emergency medical attention: 
      ï¿½ an allergic reaction (difficulty breathing; closing of your throat; swelling of your lips, face, or tongue; hives); or 
      ï¿½ hallucinations, abnormal behavior, or severe confusion. 
 ï¿½  Other, less serious side effects may be more likely to occur. Continue to take zolpidem and talk to your doctor if you experience 
      ï¿½ headache, drowsiness, dizziness, or clumsiness; 
      ï¿½ nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation; 
      ï¿½ depression; 
      ï¿½ muscle aches or pains; 
      ï¿½ vivid or abnormal dreams; or 
      ï¿½ amnesia (memory loss) after a dose. 
 ï¿½  A problem that may occur when sleep medicines are stopped is known as ""rebound insomnia."" This means that a person may have more trouble sleeping the first few nights after the medicine is stopped than before starting the medicine. If you should experience rebound insomnia, do not get discouraged. This problem usually goes away on its own after 1 or 2 nights  
 ï¿½  Zolpidem is habit forming. Stopping this medication suddenly can cause withdrawal effects if you have taken it continuously for several weeks. Talk to your doctor about the safe use of this medication. 
 ï¿½  Side effects other than those listed here may also occur. Talk to your doctor about any side effect that seems unusual or that is especially bothersome.",Ambien,,,,,,,,Really scary!,hallucinations,,,,,,,,,,,,,I literally wondered if he put something in my food!,husband,,,,,,,"Yes: OH YEAH, Ambien can do some wacky stuff.

I have been given lorcet plus which does not help, and can't seem to get the docs to understand just how severe the pain is.","Get the MRI.  You need to BE SURE your pain is not the result of a serious brain lesion/condition.   Hyper-reflexia is a sign of an 'upper motor neuron lesion'.  This can be caused by several types of central nervous system injury (conditions that can be very serious).  So take seriously the recommendation for the MRI.

If the MRI is 'negative', that is, it is normal, then it may be time to get additional opinions about the possible causes of your pain. A good Chiropractic evaluation and a Naturopathic Evaluation might be a good idea.

Also, if no obvious physical cause of your chronic pains can be found, then I would suggest an excellent book by Sherry Rogers, M.D. called: ""Pain Free in 6 Weeks"".  The book is available from Amazon.com or her publisher at 1-800-846-6687.

Early intervention is key in cases of Autism Spectrum Disorders and Nonverbal Learning Disorder, and delayed speech.

Please ask her to take the following steps immediately:

Find a pediatrician that specializes in children with developmental disabilities.

Contact the school system for a complete evaluation (this is free, and could have been before the child trained 3!).

The school system will choose a team of professionals to evaluate the child, including, but not limited to a speech therapist, an occupational therapist, a physical therapist, a school adjustment counselor, a school psychologist, a teacher and an expert in special education.  His parents  will be part of the team, and they may bring any experts they so choose to the team meetings.

The child's new pediatrician will submit a recommendation for the services the child needs.  The child may require an independent evaluation by additional specialists (pediatric neurologist, etc. to develop a treatment plan.

Make sure that the team adopts the recommendations of his pediatrician and specialists in their entirety; appeal the team's decision, if necessary.

The team will develop an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) that specifies the services to be provided and the frequency of the provision, as well as the modifications that will be made to ""regular"" education to accommodate him.

His parents have the right to accept or reject the IEP, in whole or in part, and appeal same, in whole or in part.  If they choose to appeal and another, independent evaluation is required, the school must pay for the evaluation.

The school system is required BY LAW to provide early intervention services beginning at age 3, so he will probably begin in a special program, immediately.

I am tires of being ""mildly sick"" all the time. I did the saliva test and it was positive. If it is the Candida that is causing this trouble, I would like to kill it now. I want to do it  naturally and know how to prevent it from coming back.

Thanks to whoever can help me

Daniel","Colloidal Silver is good stuff. That might work but either make it yourself http://curezone.com/forums/m.asp?f=97&i=1054

In addition to taking a tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar & Cinnamon three times a day for at least a month, I would add two to three drops of green hull black walnut oil or wild oregeno oil to some apple juice to help kill parasites and drink three glasses of distilled water with a tablespoon of unrefined sea salt. You will not believe how much better you will feel after just two weeks. 

There are other methods to cure Candida. Keep trying different methods until you dicover what works for you but make sure you stick with whatever you try to give it a chance to work. Candida is caused by a powerful acid/alkaline imbalance and likewise will take some discomfort and care to repair. Apple Cider Vinegar and Sea Salt & Distilled Water and or Colloidal Silver might be the easiest way to beat Candida but everyone is their own batch of chemicals and what works for me might not work for you.

There are also wonderful Candida Support Forums

4458492,"Strep Throat, or Wisdom teeth problems?","Ok, so I have been sick these past couple of days thinking I had strep throat running a 102.9 fever. My throat is still killing me, a headache here and there but the fever has gone down to around 100.7. I am feelin alot better now the fever is down, but I am also getting my top left wisdom tooth in, it has not caused me any problems at all, however I have noticed that my teeth are sore. Does this have anything to do with my Wisdom Teeth or is it strep like the Dr. said??","Sounds like strep. Wisdom teeth don't cause fevers. Just soreness. Since the doctor said strep, I assume you are taking antibiotics. Please make sure to take the full dose you were given. Strep can be very dangerous to your heart if the bacteria is not fully eradicated -- rheumatic fever! Take care and I hope you feel all better soon.",Strep Throat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Does this have anything to do with my Wisdom Teeth or is it strep like the Dr. said??,102.9 fever,,,,,,,,,Yes: Take care and I hope you feel all better soon.
